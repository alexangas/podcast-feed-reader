        Bobby Lee exploded on the comedy scene with 8 seasons of the classic show "MAD TV" but has since gone on to do sitcoms, movies, national ad campaigns and of course headlining comedy shows nationwide!
        On this incredible episode, he talks with hosts Carl Kozlowski and Christina Hepburn about how he thinks Chewbacca should have responded to Han Solo's death in the last "Star Wars" movie, life on "MAD TV," his past drug addiction and how he overcame it, why musicals scare him, and much more in addition to laughing at Carl for attempting to sing like Prince, ordering Christina to take Carl's Diet Dr. Pepper and  Diet Snapple away from him, and asking them embarrassing questions about what they would do to certain celebrities in order to make it in Hollywood. This is very NSFW at times, so now you have only yourself to blame if you don't like it! But if you have a sense of humor, you're gonna love this!

      <link>http://www.spreaker.com/user/6733116/grown-ass-men-ep-89-legendary-comic-paul</link>
      <description>In this powerful episode, mixed with laughter and near-tears at times, legendary comic Paul Rodriguez (on the Top 100 Comics of All Time list on Comedy Central) stopped in to discuss the his favorite Garry Shandling (RIP) memories, the state of the election (Trump!), how a two-week jail stay might have saved his life but his still-urgent desire for prison reform, the Black Lives Matter movement, being a Latino Republican in a heavily Democratic industry like Hollywood, how greed ruins major world charities, and why comics are tormented souls. And that's just half of it! You've gotta hear this!</description>

Then we got funny again with comic Richard Villa of the Improv’s “Refried Fridays” shows, and learned how he’s building a comedy empire all the way to Germany. One hell of a show!</description>
