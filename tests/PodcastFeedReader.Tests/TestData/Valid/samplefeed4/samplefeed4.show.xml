<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The Art of Charm Podcast is where curious, hungry, self-motivated people come to learn from an unparalleled mix of teachers, thinkers and mentors.

And our subject is you.

We’re AJ and Jordan Harbinger, your hosts. In our early 20s, we decided to take our lives to the next level. To document our journey, we started The Art of Charm Podcast.

Since then, the show has grown into a global community of driven people—just like you—who want to take control of their lives by learning from the world’s leading experts. This is the show we wish we had a decade ago.

Our guests include productivity experts like Tim Ferriss, management gurus like Seth Godin, best-selling authors like Neil Strauss, Michael Port, and Ramit Sethi as well as other incredible teachers, thinkers and builders sharing their greatest insights right here, for free. Topics range from networking, public speaking, negotiation, dating and sex to finance and career advice to life-hacking and fitness—every aspect of a rich, fulfilling life.

So you can think of us in a few different ways. We’re the older brothers you never had. We’re the MBA you’d like to pursue. We’re the entrepreneurs sharing war stories at the bar. And we’re the students who are always asking, searching and growing at every step, right along with you.

We’re The Art of Charm. Where ordinary people become extraordinary.

<description><![CDATA[The Art of Charm Podcast is where self-motivated guys and gals, just like you, come to learn from a diverse mix of experienced mentors, including the world's best dating coaches, relationship experts, entrepreneurs, bestselling authors and other professional badasses.  This is not about how to get the best out of others, it's about YOU.

We're AJ & Jordan Harbinger. In our early 20s, we decided it was time to take our lives to the next level, especially in the realm of professional networking, dating and relationships. We learned from the best performance coaches, entrepreneurs, hustlers, life-hackers, fashion and image consultants from around the world and created a program unlike anything available anywhere.  We talk in-depth about the stuff you're hungry to explore but only really dig up after a few drinks.

We created The Art of Charm Podcast to help you take control of your destiny and get practical guidance from a wide range of experts. We do this by interviewing the best in the business and making their knowledge available to you right here, for free.  Guests range from Motivational Speakers to Entrepreneurs to Tim Ferris to Dog the Bounty Hunter.  Topics include networking, business, dating, relationships, sex, career advice, fitness & nutrition, life-hacking and lifestyle design.
