<p>Jeffrey Brown visited the set of &#8220;Mercy Street&#8221; in Richmond, Virginia, and has this preview.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Spring 1862: The carnage on the Civil War goes on, and some of the wounded and dying are brought here to Mansion House Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>ACTOR</strong>: Ah. You must be the new nurse. I am Dr. Hale, chief operating surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: &#8220;Mercy Street&#8221; is a dramatized account based on memoirs and letters of doctors and nurses who served at a Union facility that also took in a handful of Confederate soldiers.</p>
<p>The real Mansion House, a one-time luxury hotel transformed into an Army hospital, was in Alexandria, Virginia, just south of Washington. The series was filmed further south in Petersburg, Virginia, as well as in Richmond at a Civil War-period mansion, where we visited last summer as shooting was wrapping up.</p>
<p>Josh Radnor plays Jedediah Foster, a civilian surgeon now caught up in the pain, frustrations and blood of the war.</p>
<p><strong>JOSH RADNOR</strong>, &#8220;Dr. Jedediah Foster&#8221;: Be prepared. This may bleed a bit.</p>
<p><strong>ACTRESS</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>JOSH RADNOR: It&#8217;s life and death in a hospital. Plus, you throw the Civil War on top of it, you have got pretty much the most dramatic situation you could ever imagine.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s this feeling that it&#8217;s entirely grounded in its time and place, and, at the same time, it feels modern and urgent and vital. It feels like you&#8217;re walking into this, like, bustling, alive, relatable story with people that you recognize somehow.</p>
<p><strong>ACTOR</strong>: This is what happens to traitors.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Alexandria was the only Confederate town occupied by the Union for all four years of the war, and much of the drama here involves the interaction of Northerners and Southerners.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re enemies, but also at times forced to work side by side, as with two volunteer nurses, one a staunch New England abolitionist, the other an inexperienced young woman whose life has been upended by occupation.</p>
<p>Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays the Northerner Mary Phinney.</p>
<p><strong>MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD</strong>, &#8220;Mary Phinney&#8221;: Both feel very passionately about what they believe in, but, as the series goes on, you kind of see the complexities in who they both are, and they find ways to connect, even though they have such differing views on such very big, big issues. They see the humanity in one another and are able to kind of to work alongside each other.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Ridley Scott served as executive producer of the series. It was created and written by David Zabel and Lisa Wolfinger, he known for his work writing and overseeing the hit network drama &#8220;ER,&#8221; she a veteran writer and producer of films and TV programs.</p>
<p><strong>LISA WOLFINGER</strong>, Producer, &#8220;Mercy Street&#8221;: I thought, well, maybe, maybe we can find a new way to tell an old story. And it hit me that nobody has ever really explored the medical side of it. We kind of like to think of this show as &#8220;Gone With the Wind&#8221; meets &#8220;MASH.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>DAVID ZABEL</strong>, Producer, &#8220;Mercy Street&#8221;: We wanted to find a way to find the drama in the medical. How do we tell the story of medical advances during the Civil War, but infuse it with drama? And Alexandria, Virginia, became this great window into all &#8212; a whole bunch of different aspects of the war and all kinds of different characters.</p>
<p>It really became much more of a family saga combined with a medical drama combined with sort of a wartime epic.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: One of the most complex and moving stories in &#8220;Mercy Street&#8221; is that of Samuel Diggs, a free black working as a orderly in the hospital.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d grown up a servant in the home of a Philadelphia doctor and, unbeknownst to the Mansion House staff, had learned a great deal about medical practice. As the story unfolds, he gets the chance to do work otherwise denied him in a segregated society.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking to a man with a lot of blood on his sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>MCKINLEY BELCHER III</strong>, &#8220;Samuel Diggs&#8221;: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Well-earned?</p>
<p><strong>MCKINLEY BELCHER III</strong>: Well-earned. This is actually the blood of my love on my sleeves.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: The blood of your love?</p>
<p><strong>MCKINLEY BELCHER III</strong>: Yes, the blood of my love.</p>
<p>We did a scene yesterday, all yesterday, that we were sort of operating on her, so, yes.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Actor McKinley Belcher III told us this role had special meaning for him.</p>
<p><strong>MCKINLEY BELCHER III</strong>: I think, for Samuel, that how strongly he feels about being a doctor and being involved in the medical world is something that&#8217;s sort of at the forefront of his mind all the time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m playing a young man who is single-minded, in many ways a positive image of a young black man, and who is career-oriented, has integrity, and a sort of quiet strength about him. It makes me really proud to put that out in the world. And I think, in some ways, as an artist, I have to be responsible for the images I portray and for the truth I put out in the world. And I&#8217;m proud of this one.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: The producers also clearly took some pride in the series&#8217; authenticity. A Civil War hospital was no setting for the squeamish. Amputations were performed numerous times each day with minimal or no anesthesia.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re standing in front of a pretty bloody scene, right, at least fake blood.</p>
<p>Surgeon and medical historian Stanley Burns served as consultant to the series.</p>
<p><strong>DR. STANLEY BURNS</strong>, Medical Historian: This is a capital operating kit. This is what a surgeon used during the war. And there were several of them at each regiment. For instance, we show in one of the scenes &#8212; let me take this out &#8212; they&#8217;re still sharp and problematical.</p>
<p>And so, this is a capital amputation saw. They actually took the saw, you see, around the arm, and then, in one fell swoop, cut it off.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: That&#8217;s how you do it, yes.</p>
<p><strong>DR. STANLEY BURNS</strong>: The whole amputation, if the surgeons were slow, it would take five minutes, but a good, experienced surgeon could do it, complete an amputation in two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Series creators Wolfinger and Zabel say they worked hard for realism and were happy PBS embraced it.</p>
<p><strong>LISA WOLFINGER</strong>: PBS was such a natural home for it, and I think in many ways we designed it for PBS.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID ZABEL</strong>: If we tried to tell this story in a lot of other places, there would be a lot more pressure to, I think, stray, stray from the facts, from the history.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: It&#8217;s a view of history not from the battlefield, but through the lives of those trying to heal its victims.</p>
<p>The six-part miniseries &#8220;Mercy Street&#8221; premieres Sunday night.</p>
<p>From Richmond, Virginia, I&#8217;m Jeffrey Brown for the &#8220;PBS NewsHour.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: And you can stream the first episode of &#8220;Mercy Street&#8221; online right now about PBS.org. And the broadcast premiere is Sunday on most PBS stations.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Brown has our look at who&#8217;s in this year&#8217;s field, and getting just as much attention, who&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>When it comes to Oscar nominations this year, it is a very cruel world, indeed. &#8220;The Revenant,&#8221; a revenge tale set in the American wilderness in the 1800s, gained the most nominations, 12 in all, including for best picture, best director Alejandro Inarritu, who won last year for &#8220;Birdman,&#8221; and in the leading actor category for Leonardo DiCaprio, a megastar who famously has never won an Oscar.</p>
<p>The second most honored film with 10 nominations portrayed a different kind of struggle for survival. &#8220;Mad Max: Fury Road&#8221; is set in a not-so-distant future that we can all only hope to avoid. It&#8217;s a sequel to the popular trilogy that began in 1979. Director George Miller, who also created and directed the earlier series, gained a nomination for the new film, this time using a female lead.</p>
<p><strong>CHARLIZE THERON</strong>, Actress: This is the best shot I will ever have.</p>
<p>Mike Sargent is a film critic for Pacifica Radio.</p>
<p><strong>MIKE SARGENT</strong>, Film Critic, Pacifica Radio: And they&#8217;re both definitely about survival, but they both are taking, in many ways, simple stories and just telling them really well. &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; is essentially one long chase film, but it&#8217;s shot and staged and mounted in a way no one&#8217;s ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>KATE MARA</strong>, Actress: That&#8217;s tracking right towards us.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Unlike many other years, though, the races in this and other key categories are considered up for grabs. Six other films join &#8220;The Revenant&#8221; and &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; on the best picture list, &#8220;The Big Short,&#8221; &#8220;Bridge of Spies, &#8220;Brooklyn,&#8221; &#8220;The Martian,&#8221; &#8220;Room,&#8221; and &#8220;Spotlight.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were some familiar names in the acting categories. Among the men, in addition to DiCaprio, Matt Damon in &#8220;The Martian,&#8221; Bryan Cranston in &#8220;Trumbo,&#8221; and last year&#8217;s winner, Eddie Redmayne, among women, former winner Cate Blanchett for &#8220;Carol,&#8221; and Jennifer Lawrence for &#8220;Joy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a relative newcomer, Brie Larson, seems to be the odds-on favorite for her performance in &#8220;Room&#8221; as a woman held captive for years with her young son now adjusting to the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>BRIE LARSON</strong>, Actress: I just want him to connect with something.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Slate film critic Dana Steven.</p>
<p><strong>DANA STEVENS</strong>, Film Critic, Slate: Brie Larson is absolutely wonderful in &#8220;Room&#8221; and a genuine breakthrough kind of performance. And she is not a name that is widely known outside of cinephilic circles in the last few years. And, suddenly, she&#8217;s burst into stardom and greater visibility with this role.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Most notably missing again for the second straight year, actors of color, an issue that&#8217;s put its own spotlight on Hollywood for its lack of diversity at every level.</p>
<p><strong>MIKE SARGENT</strong>: And though I think Cheryl Boone Isaacs, who is the head of the Academy now, has made great strides in the last couple years to include more people of color, more women, more people under a certain age in the academy, it still is dominated primarily by men, primarily by white men over 60, 65, and the choices of films and actors often reflect a sensibility, and maybe let&#8217;s just say a sensibility that&#8217;s time perhaps has come and gone.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Among those left off the best actor list was Idris Elba for &#8220;Beasts of no Nation,&#8221; and Benicio Del Toro for &#8220;Sicario.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film &#8220;Straight Outta Compton&#8221; about the rap group NWA had been wildly praised, but was shut out of major nominations.</p>
<p><strong>DANA STEVENS</strong>: I always sort of think, well, it&#8217;s earlier up the pipeline that things should have been fixed. Right? The problem is that there aren&#8217;t people of color and women out there making movies and getting the directing jobs and acting jobs. And if they were there, we would have more choices to pick from.</p>
<p>However, there are exceptions to that even this year, for example, Ryan Coogler, the director of &#8220;Creed,&#8221; African-American director, and a great performance by Michael B. Jordan in that role. But neither of them was recognized. Instead, it&#8217;s the white supporting actor, Sylvester Stallone, who got recognized for &#8220;Creed.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: &#8220;Star Wars,&#8221; the top grossing film of 2015, won nominations in several technical categories.</p>
<p>Just how important are these nominations for these films?</p>
<p><strong>MIKE SARGENT</strong>: All films benefit from getting nominated, especially the Oscars. There&#8217;s something they call the Oscar bump. And I think we&#8217;re going to see these films make at least 20 percent more than they would have if they didn&#8217;t get nominated.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: The Academy Awards ceremony itself remains a very big deal, one of the most watched programs of the year.</p>
<p>But after last year&#8217;s 15 percent drop in viewership, from 43 million to 37 million, producers are aiming for a bit of a reboot. Chris Rock will host the Oscar broadcast on February 28.</p>
<p>There was also sad news in the film world today with the passing of Alan Rickman, a classically trained British actor who performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and earned two Tony Award nominations, and who often showcased that pedigree in film roles, such as Colonel Brandon in &#8220;Sense and Sensibility.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/alan-rickman-the-villain-you-loved-to-love-dies-at-69/">READ MORE: Alan Rickman, the villain you loved to love, dies at 69</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>ALAN RICKMAN</strong>, Actor: I have described Mr. Willoughby as the worst of libertines, but I have since learned from Lady Allen that he did mean to propose that day.</p>
<p><strong>DANA STEVENS</strong>: It was hard for me to pay attention to those breaking Oscar nominations this morning after hearing the news that Alan Rickman had died, because, to me, that&#8217;s just such a blow for the world of cinema. He was such a great performer with incredible range.</p>
<p><strong>ALAN RICKMAN</strong>: Get them back.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: On screen, Rickman became best known for his roles as the villain, playing German psychopath Hans Gruber in &#8220;Die Hard.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>ALAN RICKMAN</strong>: Yippee ki yay, mother-.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: And he was the dastardly sheriff of Nottingham in &#8220;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>ALAN RICKMAN</strong>: And call off Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: For which he won a British Academy and Film Award.</p>
<p>And, of course, for a new generation, he was master of the dark arts of magic, Severus Snape, in the &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; franchise.</p>
<p><strong>ALAN RICKMAN</strong>: Should anyone, student or staff, attempt to aid Mr. Potter, they will be punished.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: In another vein, in the Christmas favorite &#8220;Love Actually&#8221; Rickman was a husband to Emma Thompson, pathetically flirting with adultery.</p>
<p><strong>ALAN RICKMAN</strong>: I&#8217;m so in love with you, a classic fool.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: During his 30-year career, Rickman never won an Oscar, but once said, &#8220;Parts win prizes, not actors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alan Rickman&#8217;s family announced today that he died from a battle with cancer. He was 69 years old.</p>
<p>For the PBS NewsHour, I&#8217;m Jeffrey Brown.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Brown has our look at who&#8217;s in this year&#8217;s field, and getting just as much attention, who&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>When it comes to Oscar nominations this year, it is a very cruel world, indeed. &#8220;The Revenant,&#8221; a revenge tale set in the American wilderness in the 1800s, gained the most nominations, 12 in all, including for best picture, best director Alejandro Inarritu, who won last year for &#8220;Birdman,&#8221; and in the leading actor category for Leonardo DiCaprio, a megastar who famously has never won an Oscar.</p>
<p>The second most honored film with 10 nominations portrayed a different kind of struggle for survival. &#8220;Mad Max: Fury Road&#8221; is set in a not-so-distant future that we can all only hope to avoid. It&#8217;s a sequel to the popular trilogy that began in 1979. Director George Miller, who also created and directed the earlier series, gained a nomination for the new film, this time using a female lead.</p>
<p><strong>CHARLIZE THERON</strong>, Actress: This is the best shot I will ever have.</p>
<p>Mike Sargent is a film critic for Pacifica Radio.</p>
<p><strong>MIKE SARGENT</strong>, Film Critic, Pacifica Radio: And they&#8217;re both definitely about survival, but they both are taking, in many ways, simple stories and just telling them really well. &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; is essentially one long chase film, but it&#8217;s shot and staged and mounted in a way no one&#8217;s ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>KATE MARA</strong>, Actress: That&#8217;s tracking right towards us.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Unlike many other years, though, the races in this and other key categories are considered up for grabs. Six other films join &#8220;The Revenant&#8221; and &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; on the best picture list, &#8220;The Big Short,&#8221; &#8220;Bridge of Spies, &#8220;Brooklyn,&#8221; &#8220;The Martian,&#8221; &#8220;Room,&#8221; and &#8220;Spotlight.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were some familiar names in the acting categories. Among the men, in addition to DiCaprio, Matt Damon in &#8220;The Martian,&#8221; Bryan Cranston in &#8220;Trumbo,&#8221; and last year&#8217;s winner, Eddie Redmayne, among women, former winner Cate Blanchett for &#8220;Carol,&#8221; and Jennifer Lawrence for &#8220;Joy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a relative newcomer, Brie Larson, seems to be the odds-on favorite for her performance in &#8220;Room&#8221; as a woman held captive for years with her young son now adjusting to the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>BRIE LARSON</strong>, Actress: I just want him to connect with something.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Slate film critic Dana Steven.</p>
<p><strong>DANA STEVENS</strong>, Film Critic, Slate: Brie Larson is absolutely wonderful in &#8220;Room&#8221; and a genuine breakthrough kind of performance. And she is not a name that is widely known outside of cinephilic circles in the last few years. And, suddenly, she&#8217;s burst into stardom and greater visibility with this role.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Most notably missing again for the second straight year, actors of color, an issue that&#8217;s put its own spotlight on Hollywood for its lack of diversity at every level.</p>
<p><strong>MIKE SARGENT</strong>: And though I think Cheryl Boone Isaacs, who is the head of the Academy now, has made great strides in the last couple years to include more people of color, more women, more people under a certain age in the academy, it still is dominated primarily by men, primarily by white men over 60, 65, and the choices of films and actors often reflect a sensibility, and maybe let&#8217;s just say a sensibility that&#8217;s time perhaps has come and gone.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Among those left off the best actor list was Idris Elba for &#8220;Beasts of no Nation,&#8221; and Benicio Del Toro for &#8220;Sicario.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film &#8220;Straight Outta Compton&#8221; about the rap group NWA had been wildly praised, but was shut out of major nominations.</p>
<p><strong>DANA STEVENS</strong>: I always sort of think, well, it&#8217;s earlier up the pipeline that things should have been fixed. Right? The problem is that there aren&#8217;t people of color and women out there making movies and getting the directing jobs and acting jobs. And if they were there, we would have more choices to pick from.</p>
<p>However, there are exceptions to that even this year, for example, Ryan Coogler, the director of &#8220;Creed,&#8221; African-American director, and a great performance by Michael B. Jordan in that role. But neither of them was recognized. Instead, it&#8217;s the white supporting actor, Sylvester Stallone, who got recognized for &#8220;Creed.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: &#8220;Star Wars,&#8221; the top grossing film of 2015, won nominations in several technical categories.</p>
<p>Just how important are these nominations for these films?</p>
<p><strong>MIKE SARGENT</strong>: All films benefit from getting nominated, especially the Oscars. There&#8217;s something they call the Oscar bump. And I think we&#8217;re going to see these films make at least 20 percent more than they would have if they didn&#8217;t get nominated.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: The Academy Awards ceremony itself remains a very big deal, one of the most watched programs of the year.</p>
<p>But after last year&#8217;s 15 percent drop in viewership, from 43 million to 37 million, producers are aiming for a bit of a reboot. Chris Rock will host the Oscar broadcast on February 28.</p>
<p>There was also sad news in the film world today with the passing of Alan Rickman, a classically trained British actor who performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and earned two Tony Award nominations, and who often showcased that pedigree in film roles, such as Colonel Brandon in &#8220;Sense and Sensibility.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>ALAN RICKMAN</strong>, Actor: I have described Mr. Willoughby as the worst of libertines, but I have since learned from Lady Allen that he did mean to propose that day.</p>

<p>For six decades, Ken Van Sickle has been quietly producing photographs in his darkroom, located in the center of Manhattan. His photos range from documenting the bohemian life of New York and Paris in the 1950s and &#8217;60s to pushing the limits of the medium itself.</p>
<p><strong>KEN VAN SICKLE</strong>, Photographer: If you walk out of the front of the Flatiron Building and you walk straight across the street, you walk right through my door. Then you have to go 91 steps up the stairs, which is really good for me, because it keeps me healthy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 83 years old now. I moved into this building in 1963. And it&#8217;s rent-controlled. And it&#8217;s a landmark building, and I&#8217;m a senior citizen. So, I don&#8217;t pay much rent. That&#8217;s the only reason I can live here at all.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a favorite place to take photographs or even a favorite subject. I carry a camera. If I go out into the hallway, I carry a camera with me.</p>
<p>When I was in Paris, I was 23, I think, and I wanted to shoot everything I saw, but I didn&#8217;t have enough money to buy, like, more than like a roll of film every two weeks. And somebody said that Chet Baker was playing over at the American club. And I went over and I took two pictures, and one of them is out of focus, and the other one is a great photo.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a concerned photographer. I&#8217;m not trying to prove anything in any way politically or otherwise. I&#8217;m interested in beauty and sort of the subtle moments of everyday life.</p>
<p>This picture was called &#8220;The Regular.&#8221; The chairs in the foreground are overlapping, overlapping planes in parallel recession. This picture, I just call it &#8220;Washington Square.&#8221; Laboratories tend to print it light, but it should be dark like this.</p>
<p>Grand Central Station, I don&#8217;t know why there was only one person walking in there. I had just gotten off the train. I call this &#8220;Firemen.&#8221; The arch had caved in on five firemen. The Metropolitan Museum chose this to be in the permanent collection.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that make a good photograph. You have to think about texture and gesture and composition, and all the things that painting has in it. Technology doesn&#8217;t change the way photography is. It just &#8212; it makes it available to more people, which means there&#8217;s going to be much, much more really terrible pictures taken or pictures that are totally dependent on subject, which is all, all right.</p>
<p>If you were there when the Hindenburg caught on fire, and you took a picture of it, that&#8217;s a great photograph. But you&#8217;re not a great photographer, because you can&#8217;t repeat that in everyday things.</p>
<p>What a great photographer does is, they are consistently able to make something in a style that&#8217;s personal to themselves. My pictures don&#8217;t depend on extreme sharpness. They depend on the composition and on the subject and on the way I see it.</p>
<p>My name is Ken Van Sickle. This is my Brief But Spectacular take on sharing what I see.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Brown introduces us to a man who is little known outside his own field, but who&#8217;s working to address big issues that affect us all.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: He calls it half a good house, which sounds like a bit of a joke, but is meant very seriously.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA,</strong> Winner, 2016 Pritzker Prize: The location, it&#8217;s so important.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: For Alejandro Aravena, it&#8217;s a practical and aesthetic solution to a real world problem: growing urban populations and too little public money available to build affordable, but livable housing.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA</strong>: It&#8217;s not half of a house. It&#8217;s half of a good house. And the good is the entire difference.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: It&#8217;s the kind of seemingly simple, but big thinking that has won Aravena the Pritzker Prize, architecture&#8217;s highest award.</p>
<p>He spoke with us earlier this week from his office in Santiago, Chile.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA</strong>: Our entry point was just because we thought we were skilled designers and we had at the core of our profession a very powerful tool to tackle complex issues.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Forty-eight-year-old Aravena is the first Chilean to win the prize. He heads a firm called Elemental, a self-styled architectural, problem-solving do-tank, rather than think-tank.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s designed a number of buildings for Santiago&#8217;s Catholic University of Chile, among them, the Siamese Tower, a mathematics center, an innovation center, all built with energy efficiency and Chile&#8217;s climate in mind and, as with his buildings elsewhere in the world, in the belief that architecture too often swings between a focus on either icon or utility.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA</strong>: A good object should be able to do both. With this eye, it should be that place that you don&#8217;t even pay attention to, but it&#8217;s there to support and qualify everyday life.</p>
<p>As soon as you look at it with the other eye, it should be able to be that cultural object with artistic sculptural qualities. For some reason, good objects have the capacity to do both. It happens very rarely in the history of architecture, i mean, really rarely, once every decade or something. That&#8217;s my kind of experience.</p>
<p>But, nevertheless, despite the difficulty to achieve such double condition, at least that&#8217;s what I think is the aim of good architecture.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Aravena&#8217;s work in urban housing draws the most attention. According to the Pritzker jury citation, he epitomizes the revival of a more socially engaged architect, especially in his long-term commitment to tackling the global housing crisis and fighting for a better urban environment for all.</p>
<p>According to the U.N., in 2009, the number of urban residents surpassed those living in rural areas, a trend in the making for decades and expected to grow.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA</strong>: We&#8217;re living in an urban age. The same way that there has been the Stone Age and &#8212; or the Bronze Age, we&#8217;re living in the urban age.</p>
<p>The problem is that the scale and the speed and scarcity of means with which we have to respond to this process of urbanization has no precedent in human history. So, we need to generate new knowledge in order to accommodate the people migrating towards cities.</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t do so, it&#8217;s not that people will stop coming to cities. They will come anyhow, but they will live in slums and favelas and informal settlements.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: In this new world, Aravena says, architects must engage first and foremost with what we&#8217;d often think of as non-architectural issues.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA</strong>: This should be the starting point for architecture: Identify problems that are simple enough that you get the threat or the challenge in one word, pollution, waste, congestion, insecurity, migration, social tension. Those are the kind of issues that we tend to identify rather quickly in cities.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: The half a good house idea is one answer, so-called incremental housing built at low cost, half of the structure with the basics provided through public funding, the other half to be filled in and completed by the owners as and when they can.</p>
<p>The result: People can remain close to city centers, jobs and resources while living in their own homes. And instead of standardized high-rise projects, these customized homes can gain value with sweat equity.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA</strong>: Because, in the end, a housing policy shouldn&#8217;t be a mere shelter against the environment. It should work as a tool to overcome poverty.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Aravena&#8217;s firm has built more than 2,500 of these units to date in Chile and Mexico. On a larger scale, he&#8217;s overseeing a plan to reconstruct the Chilean city of Constitucion after it was devastated by a 2010 earthquake and tsunami.</p>
<p>Here, as elsewhere, he&#8217;s taken a participatory approach, asking local residents to get involved, weigh in, even vote on development approaches.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA</strong>: We wanted to introduce people as part of the discussions. And, by doing that, that new kind was a consortium that wasn&#8217;t there before. So, we were channeling public money, private money and people&#8217;s opinion and synthesizing all those forces in the design for the future of the city.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Aravena hopes the Pritzker Prize will help spread his ideas about socially engaged architecture.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA</strong>: The feeling that is here in the office is that of freedom, of now we are more comfortable in taking even more risks into going in unexplored fields. The path ahead, I think, is unwritten.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Aravena will get to promote his vision further on an international stage later this year, when he serves as director of the prestigious Venice Architecture Biennale.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Brown introduces us to a man who is little known outside his own field, but who&#8217;s working to address big issues that affect us all.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: He calls it half a good house, which sounds like a bit of a joke, but is meant very seriously.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA,</strong> Winner, 2016 Pritzker Prize: The location, it&#8217;s so important.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: For Alejandro Aravena, it&#8217;s a practical and aesthetic solution to a real world problem: growing urban populations and too little public money available to build affordable, but livable housing.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA</strong>: It&#8217;s not half of a house. It&#8217;s half of a good house. And the good is the entire difference.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: It&#8217;s the kind of seemingly simple, but big thinking that has won Aravena the Pritzker Prize, architecture&#8217;s highest award.</p>
<p>He spoke with us earlier this week from his office in Santiago, Chile.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA</strong>: Our entry point was just because we thought we were skilled designers and we had at the core of our profession a very powerful tool to tackle complex issues.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Forty-eight-year-old Aravena is the first Chilean to win the prize. He heads a firm called Elemental, a self-styled architectural, problem-solving do-tank, rather than think-tank.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s designed a number of buildings for Santiago&#8217;s Catholic University of Chile, among them, the Siamese Tower, a mathematics center, an innovation center, all built with energy efficiency and Chile&#8217;s climate in mind and, as with his buildings elsewhere in the world, in the belief that architecture too often swings between a focus on either icon or utility.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO ARAVENA</strong>: A good object should be able to do both. With this eye, it should be that place that you don&#8217;t even pay attention to, but it&#8217;s there to support and qualify everyday life.</p>
<p>As soon as you look at it with the other eye, it should be able to be that cultural object with artistic sculptural qualities. For some reason, good objects have the capacity to do both. It happens very rarely in the history of architecture, i mean, really rarely, once every decade or something. That&#8217;s my kind of experience.</p>
<p>But, nevertheless, despite the difficulty to achieve such double condition, at least that&#8217;s what I think is the aim of good architecture.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Aravena&#8217;s work in urban housing draws the most attention. According to the Pritzker jury citation, he epitomizes the revival of a more socially engaged architect, especially in his long-term commitment to tackling the global housing crisis and fighting for a better urban environment for all.</p>

<p>In part two of his report, Jeffrey Brown profiles a man who lost his way and then found it again, in prison, through poetry.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>, Poet: All our thoughts were beginnings. And you became the roundness that grew to a moon above your mother&#8217;s hips.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: We first met Reginald Dwayne Betts in Chicago at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Facility, where he&#8217;d come to read his poetry to young inmates and answer their questions.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: If I never got caught, do I think &#8212; so you&#8217;re just going to put me on the spot like that?</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Does it take you back when you walk in a place like this?</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: Mostly no, because it&#8217;s really different walking in from the side I walk in now. And so the reason it takes me back is I recognize how different the experience is.</p>
<p>And then, when I see the kids, though, it takes me back, because all of them remind me of me when I was younger.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Betts grew up 700 miles to the east in Suitland, Maryland, a community southeast of Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: This is my first time being back in a while, yes</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: He was a bright child, an honor student who loved to read, and had hopes for college, despite being surrounded by drugs, occasional violence and peers who&#8217;d been locked up.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: I expected myself to be the exception, despite the fact that I smoked weed, just like everybody else, and I kind of hung around out here late at night, just like everybody else. I guess I thought I would end up different.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: I thought I was smart. I thought I was better. I thought I could beat the odds, maybe. And I thought the stuff that I was doing wasn&#8217;t that bad anyway.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: That all changed on the evening of December 7, 1996, at this mall in Springfield, Virginia, when then 16-year-old Betts and a friend used a gun to rob a man and steal his car.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: I recognized carjacking was wrong and it was crazy, but, in the spur of the moment, I just didn&#8217;t think about it at all.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Betts was arrested the very next day. It was his first run-in with the law. He was transferred to adult court and later given a nine-year sentence.</p>
<p>So, you go to prison, you&#8217;re a teenager, and you&#8217;re among adults.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Scary?</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: Yes. I couldn&#8217;t go and bring my mom water late at night if she wanted water. I didn&#8217;t have my own bed to sleep in. So that was part of being terrified, is just what it meant for now being an adult and to be on my own.</p>
<p>And then the other part of being terrified, I think, was just partly prison is a dangerous and scary place, and you never know what&#8217;s going to happen from, you know, one moment to the next.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Reading became a comfort, and one day changed his life altogether when he was handed a copy of Dudley Randall&#8217;s &#8220;The Black Poets,&#8221; an anthology that would open his eyes to the possibilities of poetry.</p>
<p>What did it give you, being there in prison?</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: Well, the poetry gave me ability to access the world and communicate my ideas and my feelings about the world.</p>
<p>And, also, it was my idea of how to be somebody. Being a poet, for me, was being somebody. And it gave me something to pursue, and I could easily tell when I was doing it right by people&#8217;s response. And, also, I just really admire poets, Etheridge Knight, Sonia Sanchez, Robert Hayden, Amiri Baraka, Jack Gilbert, Agha Shahid Ali, just people who I found able to say something to me about a world that I didn&#8217;t know in verse, and I just aspired to be able to do that.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: After getting out of prison, Betts attended community college, taught middle school, and earned his undergraduate and master&#8217;s degrees. And he wrote, a memoir and two books of poetry. The latest is titled &#8220;Bastards of the Reagan Era.&#8221;</p>
<p>The poems, he says, speak of a generation of black men lost to drugs, violence and long prison terms.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: So lost in terms of maybe not coming up with a father in the house, but, more significantly, lost in a way in which &#8212; almost as if the larger community has abandoned you.</p>
<p>You know, we can look around, and we can look at the playground. We could go to the schools and look at the school system, and we could ask ourselves what kind of opportunities were available for this kid or that kid or that kid.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the City That Nearly Broke Me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No indictment follows Malik&#8217;s death, follows smoke running from a fired pistol. An old quarrel, crimson against concrete and the officer&#8217;s gun still smoking. Someone says the people need to stand up, that the system&#8217;s a glass house falling on only a few heads.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I talk in D.C., a lot of the poems were written when I was teaching in Southeast. I was teaching in Hart Middle School. And some of the poems come out of that experience, just thinking about how sometimes that it&#8217;s just overwhelmingly difficult.</p>
<p>And, in fact, I had more moments of just heartbreak, I think, and tragedy teaching than I did in prison. And so, in those poems, I think I&#8217;m fixating on the thing that causes me so much pain, not to the exclusion of everything else, but to the point that I really want to have to confront what it means to meet somebody that you really think is brilliant, and know that it might not pan out for them the way you want.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Betts himself is now finishing law school at Yale University. And he&#8217;s also an advocate for prison reform, particularly for the treatment of juveniles.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: The question is, do some people have to get locked up to get to that certain point where they can make themselves better in life?</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: And serves on the White House Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.</p>
<p>When it came up when we were together in Chicago from some of the young inmates there, in a sense, was it better for you to go to prison? You started reading, you started writing. Everything that&#8217;s happened to you since came from that.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: Yes, so I guess I tend to push back on that.</p>
<p>I was fortunate in a lot of ways. Like, I was safe in prison, and you can&#8217;t bank on being safe in prison. You know, you could say that prison was the catalyst for all that, and I think that that would be true, but there&#8217;s also an argument to be made that, for that to happen, a lot of things had to fall in place in a perfect way.</p>
<p>I always say that what that signals is not the benefit of prison, but what that signals is the dearth of opportunities and the dearth of imagination in the lives of a lot of young folks, that, really, we have to rely on things like institutions to supply the notion that &#8212; not that you could rise above your circumstances, but that your circumstances should include something more, that your circumstances should include being a writer.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: And what is the plan now?</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: The plan now, to be a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: To be a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: To be a lawyer.</p>
<p>I want to try to solve big problems. Somebody told me yesterday that you don&#8217;t go to Yale Law School to play it safe. And he said, despite the fact that you got three felonies, you&#8217;re playing with house money, and you need to make a decision about what you could do that&#8217;s actually ambitious and test the possibilities of the world. And can you think of ways to solve big problems?</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: And writing?</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: And writing, always writing. Writing is like breathing, so always writing, always writing.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: From Suitland, Maryland, I&#8217;m Jeffrey Brown for the &#8220;PBS NewsHour.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: The first part of Jeffrey Brown&#8217;s report looks at a writing program in one of the nation&#8217;s largest juvenile detention facilities. That&#8217;s on our Web site at PBS.org/NewsHour.</p>

<p>And, in fact, I had more moments of just heartbreak, I think, and tragedy teaching than I did in prison. And so, in those poems, I think I&#8217;m fixating on the thing that causes me so much pain, not to the exclusion of everything else, but to the point that I really want to have to confront what it means to meet somebody that you really think is brilliant, and know that it might not pan out for them the way you want.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Betts himself is now finishing law school at Yale University. And he&#8217;s also an advocate for prison reform, particularly for the treatment of juveniles.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: The question is, do some people have to get locked up to get to that certain point where they can make themselves better in life?</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: And serves on the White House Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.</p>
<p>When it came up when we were together in Chicago from some of the young inmates there, in a sense, was it better for you to go to prison? You started reading, you started writing. Everything that&#8217;s happened to you since came from that.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: Yes, so I guess I tend to push back on that.</p>
<p>I was fortunate in a lot of ways. Like, I was safe in prison, and you can&#8217;t bank on being safe in prison. You know, you could say that prison was the catalyst for all that, and I think that that would be true, but there&#8217;s also an argument to be made that, for that to happen, a lot of things had to fall in place in a perfect way.</p>
<p>I always say that what that signals is not the benefit of prison, but what that signals is the dearth of opportunities and the dearth of imagination in the lives of a lot of young folks, that, really, we have to rely on things like institutions to supply the notion that &#8212; not that you could rise above your circumstances, but that your circumstances should include something more, that your circumstances should include being a writer.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: And what is the plan now?</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: The plan now, to be a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: To be a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: To be a lawyer.</p>
<p>I want to try to solve big problems. Somebody told me yesterday that you don&#8217;t go to Yale Law School to play it safe. And he said, despite the fact that you got three felonies, you&#8217;re playing with house money, and you need to make a decision about what you could do that&#8217;s actually ambitious and test the possibilities of the world. And can you think of ways to solve big problems?</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: And writing?</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: And writing, always writing. Writing is like breathing, so always writing, always writing.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: From Suitland, Maryland, I&#8217;m Jeffrey Brown for the &#8220;PBS NewsHour.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: The first part of Jeffrey Brown&#8217;s report looks at a writing program in one of the nation&#8217;s largest juvenile detention facilities. That&#8217;s on our Web site at PBS.org/NewsHour.</p>

<p>In a career that spanned more than five decades, the sale of more than 140 million albums, and included an ever-changing and sometimes androgynous look that led to glam rock and many other iconic moments, David Bowie remained an original to the end.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Brown has our remembrance.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Constantly changing, but somehow always uniquely himself, David Bowie was one of the culture&#8217;s heroic figures for decades, appearing in many guises, shapes and forms, leaving a mark on rock music and well beyond.</p>
<p>He was born David Jones in South London in 1947, and rose to fame first in 1969 as Major Tom in the hit song &#8220;Space Oddity,&#8221; and then, memorably, in the early &#8217;70s as another otherworldly character, Ziggy Stardust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rolling Stone&#8221; music critic Anthony DeCurtis:</p>
<p><strong>ANTHONY DECURTIS</strong>, &#8220;Rolling Stone&#8221;: Suddenly, here&#8217;s David Bowie, kind of a much more complex, subversive figure than many of those artists were. And he really gave a lot of energy for what was going to drive music, well, until now, really, but certainly through the &#8217;70s.</p>
<p>When he came on the scene, it was like, this is the future.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR</strong>: Nothing you have seen or heard about David Bowie will prepare you.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: In 1976, Bowie stepped into another artistic world, acting as the pale alien in the film &#8220;The Man Who Fell to Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, in the &#8217;80s, he became a music video and fashion icon, cementing his mainstream pop star status with a string of hits, telling his fans, let&#8217;s dance. His range of pursuits, very much including a visual sensibility, also attracted those in the art world.</p>
<p>Michael Darling is with Chicago&#8217;s Museum of Contemporary Art, which hosted an exhibition on Bowie.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL DARLING</strong>, Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art: The thing that made Bowie such a good subject for a museum exhibition is the variety of his output. We had costumes. We had stage designs, graphic designs, handwritten lyrics, and things like that.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: The range, the showmanship, playfulness all were hugely influential. Madonna spoke to it when Bowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.</p>
<p><strong>MADONNA</strong>, Musician: Before I saw David Bowie live, I was your normal, dysfunctional, rebellious teenager from the Midwest. And he has truly changed my life.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Today, other musicians and artists spoke to Bowie&#8217;s influence, including some of the day&#8217;s biggest stars.</p>
<p><strong>ANTHONY DECURTIS</strong>: It&#8217;s one thing to be influential in rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll, but when you start affecting the pop world &#8212; and by that, I mean people like Madonna or Lady Gaga &#8212; Bowie was an extremely important figure for them.</p>
<p>This idea that you could continually reinvent yourself, that every time you stepped out on the stage, it was a stage, and which character are you going to be playing? That was anybody&#8217;s guess. Bowie never seemed old. That sense of reinvention really made him seem of the time at every time.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL DARLING</strong>: So many artists these days are working across different media. They&#8217;re making videos. They&#8217;re doing performances. They&#8217;re painting. They&#8217;re taking photographs. And David Bowie was already, you know, as early as the 1960s, doing that kind of work.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Tributes also came from fans, some at a mural in his hometown, even some from very high places, such as British Prime Minister David Cameron.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID CAMERON</strong>, British Prime Minister: David Bowie was a genius. For someone of my age, he provided a lot of the soundtrack of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Bowie was married for more than 20 years to the supermodel Iman, with whom he had a daughter. He also had a son from a previous marriage.</p>
<p>He had remained active in recent years, he&#8217;d kept working. The song &#8220;Lazarus&#8221; appears on his last album, a collaboration with a jazz quartet called &#8220;Blackstar,&#8221; which was released this past Friday, on Bowie&#8217;s birthday.</p>
<p>David Bowie died of cancer Sunday night. He was 69 years old.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Brown has that story.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>, Poet: You know the truth of the quarrels and how history lets the blame go blameless for the blood that flows black in the streets.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: In a classroom inside the Cook County Temporary Juvenile Detention Center in Chicago, incarcerated young people recently gathered to hear poet Reginald Dwayne Betts read his work and take their questions.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: That&#8217;s part of what I meant by history, that it&#8217;s this bigger thing that we have to understand to even understand our own lives.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: When you come to a place like this, what are you hoping to get out of it?</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: I think, honestly, I&#8217;m trying to get them to pay attention to their own stories. So I will read a poem to them, I will talk to them, and if I get them to think about their own stories, they get to write their stories down and kind of think in a different way about how their stories shape the life that they have. And if you want a different life, you find a way to tell different stories.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Betts should know. As a teenager, he was arrested for carjacking, tried as an adult, and spent eight-and-a-half years in prison.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: Yes, because it&#8217;s really easy for me to walk in here and say that, you know, when I was 16 years old, I got locked up, and pretend like that&#8217;s the beginning of the narrative or that&#8217;s the most important part of the narrative, when, in fact, I think that it&#8217;s not the most important part of the narrative.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t want to define myself that way, because, in part, I don&#8217;t want you to define yourselves that way.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: While still in prison, Betts read intensively, began writing poetry and completed high school. And since getting out in 2005, he&#8217;s graduated from college, earned his master&#8217;s, written a memoir and two books of poetry, and at age 35 is now a third-year student at Yale Law School.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: What I want to do today is to sort of let them know that I believe what doesn&#8217;t look and what doesn&#8217;t seem to be possible right now, but I believe is possible for them, because it is implausible, but, hey, implausible happens all the time.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: This is one of the nation&#8217;s largest juvenile detention centers, on the day we visited housing over 300 young people aged 10 to 16 who are awaiting trial. As a condition to film this story, we were required to conceal their identities.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also home to a fully functioning public school, so students don&#8217;t fall behind on classwork while here.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: I want you to talk in your voice.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Betts visited through a program called Free Write Jail Arts and Literacy, which for 15 years has provided tutoring and creative writing instruction.</p>
<p>A native of Trinidad, Roger Bonair-Agard is a poet and teacher who encourages his students to find their voices using the familiar language and places around them.</p>
<p><strong>ROGER BONAIR-AGARD</strong>, The Poetry Foundation: As you might imagine, the young people here have had who they are, and how they talk, and where they live devalued for a very long time.</p>
<p>And so the idea that those voices and those places should be brought to something that could eventually be this is really important.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT</strong>: Why you looking at me like that? Why you looking at me? Because I&#8217;m willing to make a change based on my mistakes?</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: A student we spoke with read one of her new poems.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT</strong>: So I ask, why you looking at me like that? Speak. Tell me you understand I&#8217;m more than what you see. So, take that chance and get to know me.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all I have.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p>Why you looking at me like that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Do you feel like that&#8217;s going on a lot?</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT</strong>: Yes, not just me and, like, others. I found myself other people &#8212; that&#8217;s a common thing people do. Me personally, as a youth, an African-American, I get judged. I&#8217;m already &#8212; I&#8217;m detained right now, so I get will judged back because of that.</p>
<p>But, really, if people sit down and get to know me, like, such as yourself, you will know and learn that I&#8217;m a good person, I&#8217;m a good kid, and I&#8217;m not what they think I am. I&#8217;m much better than what they think I am.</p>
<p><strong>RYAN KEESLING</strong>, Director, Free Write Jail Arts and Literacy: Our work is grounded in narrative.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Ryan Keesling is the director of Free Write.</p>
<p><strong>RYAN KEESLING</strong>: Those issues are their personal issues that are serious, and they need to be processed in some way. Like, we&#8217;re not coming and saying, oh, you did this, or you did that, you had this happen to you, you had this happen to you, therefore, you are this kind of person.</p>
<p>And we just allow those issues to sort of come to the surface, and assemble pieces of art that represent their processing of those experiences.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT</strong>: So, let me grab the broken pieces, and use my thoughts as glue, put it all back together, so I can at least have a clue. Why blame myself, when I can look back at my roots, and see myself as a young boy, watching and picking up what my father used to do?</p>
<p>One day he said, son, come here. Let me show you how this works. He handed me a handful of crack and put a .22 on my waistline, which was hidden behind my shirt. He said, there&#8217;s money to be made, and you will find out what it&#8217;s worth, setting me up to die early, which say he ain&#8217;t care about my birth.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: In a place like this, does writing get you respect? It is something you &#8212; that everybody knows you do, or&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT</strong>: It&#8217;s definitely something everybody know I do.</p>
<p>To me, like, they look at it as like it&#8217;s a positive thing. And I love &#8212; I love getting praise for positive things, because I didn&#8217;t do a lot of positive stuff when I was out. So doing something positive and getting a different reaction, it&#8217;s like, OK, I ain&#8217;t never felt this before.</p>
<p>So, I mean, why not keep going with this, you know?</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Things here didn&#8217;t always seem so positive. In 1999, the ACLU sued Cook County, accusing the center of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and abuse.</p>
<p>In 2007, the federal government took over, and through a transitional administration, the population dropped from more than 800 residents to today&#8217;s 300.</p>
<p>Last year, control was handed over to Cook County&#8217;s office of the chief judge, Timothy Evans, who wants to maintain that momentum.</p>
<p><strong>TIMOTHY EVANS</strong>, Cook County Chief Judge: I think that we are changing, and we have to find a way to keep these people who&#8217;ve gone through the system from returning to the system.</p>
<p>They have to be trained how to get a job and keep a job. They have to develop skills. They can&#8217;t just be let out with $40 in their pocket and expect, oh, they&#8217;re going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>LEONARD DIXON</strong>, Superintendent, Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center: Detention is like the emergency room of the juvenile justice system.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: In charge of the day-to-day is superintendent Leonard Dixon, who has run juvenile institutions across the country, most recently in Detroit, and is known as a reformer.</p>
<p><strong>LEONARD DIXON</strong>: I believe in jails. I don&#8217;t have a problem with that. My issue is, what do you do with people when you get them in there, and what kind of services are you providing, so that you can get them back out in society, so they can do well?</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Yes. This facility is predominantly African-American.</p>
<p><strong>LEONARD DIXON</strong>: Yes, it&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Far higher percentage than the county.</p>
<p><strong>LEONARD DIXON</strong>: There&#8217;s no question about it; 96 percent of the kids in here are kids of color. And that&#8217;s a question that we need to be asking, why is it that way?</p>
<p>Is it a community? Is it the courts? It&#8217;s &#8212; all of it comes together. It&#8217;s the police department. I mean, it&#8217;s everything. Everybody has to come together to figure out why.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Dixon wants to see more cases dealt with outside these walls through halfway houses, shelters, churches, and community programs.</p>
<p>The Illinois state legislature took one step in that direction last year, passing a bill that aims to reduce the number of minors automatically tried as adults, except for the most violent crimes. It&#8217;s one drop in a wave of penal reform now being discussed across the country that Reginald Dwayne Betts and others have been advocating.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: I do think that a lot of organizations around the country, and they&#8217;re pushing to limit confinement to when it&#8217;s &#8212; only when it&#8217;s necessary. And they&#8217;re pushing to sort of find different ways within a community to treat young folks that have gotten in trouble. I think what we&#8217;re still working on now is to have better outcomes.</p>
<p>While behind us, cell doors keep clanking closed, and Malik&#8217;s casket door clanks closed, and the bodies that roll off the block and into the prisons and into the ground keep rolling, and no one will admit that this is the way America strangles itself.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: From Chicago, I&#8217;m Jeffrey Brown for the &#8220;PBS NewsHour.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>JUDY WOODRUFF</strong>: Be sure to tune in tomorrow night, when Jeff talks with Reginald Dwayne Betts about his upbringing, his time in prison, and how he found poetry.</p>
<p>On our Web site now, you can watch Betts read one of his new works titled &#8220;For the City That Nearly Broke Me.&#8221; That&#8217;s PBS.org/NewsHour.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Brown has that story.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>, Poet: You know the truth of the quarrels and how history lets the blame go blameless for the blood that flows black in the streets.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: In a classroom inside the Cook County Temporary Juvenile Detention Center in Chicago, incarcerated young people recently gathered to hear poet Reginald Dwayne Betts read his work and take their questions.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: That&#8217;s part of what I meant by history, that it&#8217;s this bigger thing that we have to understand to even understand our own lives.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: When you come to a place like this, what are you hoping to get out of it?</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: I think, honestly, I&#8217;m trying to get them to pay attention to their own stories. So I will read a poem to them, I will talk to them, and if I get them to think about their own stories, they get to write their stories down and kind of think in a different way about how their stories shape the life that they have. And if you want a different life, you find a way to tell different stories.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Betts should know. As a teenager, he was arrested for carjacking, tried as an adult, and spent eight-and-a-half years in prison.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: Yes, because it&#8217;s really easy for me to walk in here and say that, you know, when I was 16 years old, I got locked up, and pretend like that&#8217;s the beginning of the narrative or that&#8217;s the most important part of the narrative, when, in fact, I think that it&#8217;s not the most important part of the narrative.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t want to define myself that way, because, in part, I don&#8217;t want you to define yourselves that way.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: While still in prison, Betts read intensively, began writing poetry and completed high school. And since getting out in 2005, he&#8217;s graduated from college, earned his master&#8217;s, written a memoir and two books of poetry, and at age 35 is now a third-year student at Yale Law School.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: What I want to do today is to sort of let them know that I believe what doesn&#8217;t look and what doesn&#8217;t seem to be possible right now, but I believe is possible for them, because it is implausible, but, hey, implausible happens all the time.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: This is one of the nation&#8217;s largest juvenile detention centers, on the day we visited housing over 300 young people aged 10 to 16 who are awaiting trial. As a condition to film this story, we were required to conceal their identities.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also home to a fully functioning public school, so students don&#8217;t fall behind on classwork while here.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: I want you to talk in your voice.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Betts visited through a program called Free Write Jail Arts and Literacy, which for 15 years has provided tutoring and creative writing instruction.</p>
<p>A native of Trinidad, Roger Bonair-Agard is a poet and teacher who encourages his students to find their voices using the familiar language and places around them.</p>
<p><strong>ROGER BONAIR-AGARD</strong>, The Poetry Foundation: As you might imagine, the young people here have had who they are, and how they talk, and where they live devalued for a very long time.</p>
<p>And so the idea that those voices and those places should be brought to something that could eventually be this is really important.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT</strong>: Why you looking at me like that? Why you looking at me? Because I&#8217;m willing to make a change based on my mistakes?</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: A student we spoke with read one of her new poems.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT</strong>: So I ask, why you looking at me like that? Speak. Tell me you understand I&#8217;m more than what you see. So, take that chance and get to know me.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all I have.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p>Why you looking at me like that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Do you feel like that&#8217;s going on a lot?</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT</strong>: Yes, not just me and, like, others. I found myself other people &#8212; that&#8217;s a common thing people do. Me personally, as a youth, an African-American, I get judged. I&#8217;m already &#8212; I&#8217;m detained right now, so I get will judged back because of that.</p>
<p>But, really, if people sit down and get to know me, like, such as yourself, you will know and learn that I&#8217;m a good person, I&#8217;m a good kid, and I&#8217;m not what they think I am. I&#8217;m much better than what they think I am.</p>
<p><strong>RYAN KEESLING</strong>, Director, Free Write Jail Arts and Literacy: Our work is grounded in narrative.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Ryan Keesling is the director of Free Write.</p>
<p><strong>RYAN KEESLING</strong>: Those issues are their personal issues that are serious, and they need to be processed in some way. Like, we&#8217;re not coming and saying, oh, you did this, or you did that, you had this happen to you, you had this happen to you, therefore, you are this kind of person.</p>
<p>And we just allow those issues to sort of come to the surface, and assemble pieces of art that represent their processing of those experiences.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT</strong>: So, let me grab the broken pieces, and use my thoughts as glue, put it all back together, so I can at least have a clue. Why blame myself, when I can look back at my roots, and see myself as a young boy, watching and picking up what my father used to do?</p>
<p>One day he said, son, come here. Let me show you how this works. He handed me a handful of crack and put a .22 on my waistline, which was hidden behind my shirt. He said, there&#8217;s money to be made, and you will find out what it&#8217;s worth, setting me up to die early, which say he ain&#8217;t care about my birth.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: In a place like this, does writing get you respect? It is something you &#8212; that everybody knows you do, or&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT</strong>: It&#8217;s definitely something everybody know I do.</p>
<p>To me, like, they look at it as like it&#8217;s a positive thing. And I love &#8212; I love getting praise for positive things, because I didn&#8217;t do a lot of positive stuff when I was out. So doing something positive and getting a different reaction, it&#8217;s like, OK, I ain&#8217;t never felt this before.</p>
<p>So, I mean, why not keep going with this, you know?</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Things here didn&#8217;t always seem so positive. In 1999, the ACLU sued Cook County, accusing the center of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and abuse.</p>
<p>In 2007, the federal government took over, and through a transitional administration, the population dropped from more than 800 residents to today&#8217;s 300.</p>
<p>Last year, control was handed over to Cook County&#8217;s office of the chief judge, Timothy Evans, who wants to maintain that momentum.</p>
<p><strong>TIMOTHY EVANS</strong>, Cook County Chief Judge: I think that we are changing, and we have to find a way to keep these people who&#8217;ve gone through the system from returning to the system.</p>
<p>They have to be trained how to get a job and keep a job. They have to develop skills. They can&#8217;t just be let out with $40 in their pocket and expect, oh, they&#8217;re going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>LEONARD DIXON</strong>, Superintendent, Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center: Detention is like the emergency room of the juvenile justice system.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: In charge of the day-to-day is superintendent Leonard Dixon, who has run juvenile institutions across the country, most recently in Detroit, and is known as a reformer.</p>
<p><strong>LEONARD DIXON</strong>: I believe in jails. I don&#8217;t have a problem with that. My issue is, what do you do with people when you get them in there, and what kind of services are you providing, so that you can get them back out in society, so they can do well?</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Yes. This facility is predominantly African-American.</p>
<p><strong>LEONARD DIXON</strong>: Yes, it&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Far higher percentage than the county.</p>
<p><strong>LEONARD DIXON</strong>: There&#8217;s no question about it; 96 percent of the kids in here are kids of color. And that&#8217;s a question that we need to be asking, why is it that way?</p>
<p>Is it a community? Is it the courts? It&#8217;s &#8212; all of it comes together. It&#8217;s the police department. I mean, it&#8217;s everything. Everybody has to come together to figure out why.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN</strong>: Dixon wants to see more cases dealt with outside these walls through halfway houses, shelters, churches, and community programs.</p>
<p>The Illinois state legislature took one step in that direction last year, passing a bill that aims to reduce the number of minors automatically tried as adults, except for the most violent crimes. It&#8217;s one drop in a wave of penal reform now being discussed across the country that Reginald Dwayne Betts and others have been advocating.</p>
<p><strong>REGINALD DWAYNE BETTS</strong>: I do think that a lot of organizations around the country, and they&#8217;re pushing to limit confinement to when it&#8217;s &#8212; only when it&#8217;s necessary. And they&#8217;re pushing to sort of find different ways within a community to treat young folks that have gotten in trouble. I think what we&#8217;re still working on now is to have better outcomes.</p>
<p>While behind us, cell doors keep clanking closed, and Malik&#8217;s casket door clanks closed, and the bodies that roll off the block and into the prisons and into the ground keep rolling, and no one will admit that this is the way America strangles itself.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Brown has that story.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Braddock, Pennsylvania, about nine miles outside of Pittsburgh, a once thriving steel town of some 20,000, now down to one-tenth of that, and captured through the very personal lens of LaToya Ruby Frazier, the 32-year-old winner of one of this year&#8217;s MacArthur fellowships.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER</strong>, Photographer:  I see myself as an artist and a citizen that&#8217;s documenting and telling the story and building the archive of working-class families facing all this change that&#8217;s happening, because it has to be documented.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  These days, Frazier teaches and lives in Chicago, where we talked to her, but her true home, her childhood home, is the one found in her work.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a project titled &#8220;The Notion of Family&#8221; that she began more than a decade ago, documenting three generations of African-American women in a particular time and place.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  My grandmother, who grew up there in the &#8217;30s, when Braddock was prosperous and a city itself that everyone came to, to my mother growing up there in the &#8217;60s during segregation and white flight and the beginning of the collapse of the steel industry, to myself growing up there in the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s, when the factories were already dismantled and the war on drugs kind of hit its peak.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Educator and photographer Lewis Hine used his camera for social reform.  Photographers from the Farm Security Administration documented the poverty of the Depression, the pioneering work of Gordon Parks in the 1940s and &#8217;50s.  </p>
<p>Frazier sees herself working in this tradition, first and foremost, though, as a visual artist.<br />
<strong><br />
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  The art comes in with how it&#8217;s crafted, how it&#8217;s made, the material, me understanding the history, because the images, they&#8217;re not purely documents.  </p>
<p>If you look at them, first and foremost, the fact that I appear on the other side of the camera lets you know that this is contemporary art, because now I&#8217;m performing and doing gestures in front of the camera to create&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  You&#8217;re part of the scene.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  &#8230; the narrative and the scene, yes.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  But are they posed photographs?  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  They sit in between staged and documentation.  </p>
<p>If we think about the image &#8220;Grandma Ruby and Me, 2005,&#8221; I know her routine.  I know she will get up, she will have her Folgers cup of coffee, she will smoke her Pall Mall cigarettes, she will clean her dolls.  </p>
<p>So, looking at my grandmother one day, I said, well, grandma, could you redo my hair the way you used to when I was a child?  </p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m in my 20s in this image.  So, I come and I sit next to her while she&#8217;s rearranging her dolls.  And then we both quietly happen to look over our shoulders, and the cable release is running behind to the camera, and I press the cable release.</p>
<p>And so that&#8217;s how it sits between documentation and actual staged portraiture.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  In 2013, Frazier flew in a helicopter above Braddock to expand her view of the town.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  I just knew I had to shoot this, so the family could see what was happening to their property.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  And to capture the plight of one particular home owned by the Bunn family in the neighborhood known as The Bottom, right near the old plant.  It&#8217;s now surrounded by bundles of crushed rubber tires.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  And what&#8217;s interesting is, at one point, anyone who immigrated or migrated to work in this factory lived exactly these two blocks.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Really?</p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  And this is really important to me because it&#8217;s not about being black or white.  This was our rites of passage, so it didn&#8217;t matter if you came from Germany, Croatia, Italy, Africa, North Carolina, or South Carolina.  We all lived here together.  </p>
<p>And over the years, these were all, through eminent domain, taken because people died from terminal illnesses, couldn&#8217;t upstand or keep their homes.  And then this family, the Bunn family, decided that they didn&#8217;t want to move.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  In more recent years, a new story of Braddock has been told, one of grit and revival.  Levi&#8217;s even used the city in a 2010 ad campaign called &#8220;Ready for Work.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>CHILD:</strong>  Maybe the world breaks on purpose, so we can have work to do.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Frazier isn&#8217;t buying it.  </p>
<p>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:  Out of concern for this narrative and what I saw as propaganda, I started to make the portraits to counterbalance this narrative.  Right.  It&#8217;s not an empty land.  It&#8217;s not a frontier.  Like, people actually live here and have been dealing with the environmental crisis for decades.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  She points to government policies and corporate decisions like the closing of the main hospital, which had served many in the town, including Frazier&#8217;s own family, who say they suffer from environment-related illnesses.  </p>
<p>The fight over the hospital was captured in a 2012 documentary by Tony Buba, who&#8217;s been filming life in Braddock since the 1970s.  The protests became another point of Frazier&#8217;s own mix of art and activism.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  So, here, I&#8217;m talking about the history of protests.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Taken altogether, it&#8217;s a complicated picture.  Frazier wants us not to forget those who continue to struggle amid the changes.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  I&#8217;m not saying that it&#8217;s a dying town.  I&#8217;m saying that we survived.  Like, look at all of the damage, all the abuse we have endured, and we&#8217;re still steadfast and existing.  So, for me, it&#8217;s a triumphant story. It&#8217;s really a testimony.  It&#8217;s not &#8212; we&#8217;re not dying.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Even though it looks &#8212; I mean, much of it looks so depressed and depressing-type scenes.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  But look at me in the flesh right now in front of you.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  I&#8217;m not that girl.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  And she plans to use the money from the MacArthur grant, $625,000 over five years, to continue to document and complicate our picture of Braddock, Pennsylvania.  </p>

<p>Jeffrey Brown has that story.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Braddock, Pennsylvania, about nine miles outside of Pittsburgh, a once thriving steel town of some 20,000, now down to one-tenth of that, and captured through the very personal lens of LaToya Ruby Frazier, the 32-year-old winner of one of this year&#8217;s MacArthur fellowships.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER</strong>, Photographer:  I see myself as an artist and a citizen that&#8217;s documenting and telling the story and building the archive of working-class families facing all this change that&#8217;s happening, because it has to be documented.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  These days, Frazier teaches and lives in Chicago, where we talked to her, but her true home, her childhood home, is the one found in her work.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a project titled &#8220;The Notion of Family&#8221; that she began more than a decade ago, documenting three generations of African-American women in a particular time and place.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  My grandmother, who grew up there in the &#8217;30s, when Braddock was prosperous and a city itself that everyone came to, to my mother growing up there in the &#8217;60s during segregation and white flight and the beginning of the collapse of the steel industry, to myself growing up there in the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s, when the factories were already dismantled and the war on drugs kind of hit its peak.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Educator and photographer Lewis Hine used his camera for social reform.  Photographers from the Farm Security Administration documented the poverty of the Depression, the pioneering work of Gordon Parks in the 1940s and &#8217;50s.  </p>
<p>Frazier sees herself working in this tradition, first and foremost, though, as a visual artist.<br />
<strong><br />
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  The art comes in with how it&#8217;s crafted, how it&#8217;s made, the material, me understanding the history, because the images, they&#8217;re not purely documents.  </p>
<p>If you look at them, first and foremost, the fact that I appear on the other side of the camera lets you know that this is contemporary art, because now I&#8217;m performing and doing gestures in front of the camera to create&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  You&#8217;re part of the scene.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  &#8230; the narrative and the scene, yes.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  But are they posed photographs?  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  They sit in between staged and documentation.  </p>
<p>If we think about the image &#8220;Grandma Ruby and Me, 2005,&#8221; I know her routine.  I know she will get up, she will have her Folgers cup of coffee, she will smoke her Pall Mall cigarettes, she will clean her dolls.  </p>
<p>So, looking at my grandmother one day, I said, well, grandma, could you redo my hair the way you used to when I was a child?  </p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m in my 20s in this image.  So, I come and I sit next to her while she&#8217;s rearranging her dolls.  And then we both quietly happen to look over our shoulders, and the cable release is running behind to the camera, and I press the cable release.</p>
<p>And so that&#8217;s how it sits between documentation and actual staged portraiture.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  In 2013, Frazier flew in a helicopter above Braddock to expand her view of the town.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  I just knew I had to shoot this, so the family could see what was happening to their property.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  And to capture the plight of one particular home owned by the Bunn family in the neighborhood known as The Bottom, right near the old plant.  It&#8217;s now surrounded by bundles of crushed rubber tires.  </p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  And what&#8217;s interesting is, at one point, anyone who immigrated or migrated to work in this factory lived exactly these two blocks.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Really?</p>
<p><strong>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:</strong>  And this is really important to me because it&#8217;s not about being black or white.  This was our rites of passage, so it didn&#8217;t matter if you came from Germany, Croatia, Italy, Africa, North Carolina, or South Carolina.  We all lived here together.  </p>
<p>And over the years, these were all, through eminent domain, taken because people died from terminal illnesses, couldn&#8217;t upstand or keep their homes.  And then this family, the Bunn family, decided that they didn&#8217;t want to move.  </p>

<p><strong>CHILD:</strong>  Maybe the world breaks on purpose, so we can have work to do.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Frazier isn&#8217;t buying it.  </p>
<p>LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER:  Out of concern for this narrative and what I saw as propaganda, I started to make the portraits to counterbalance this narrative.  Right.  It&#8217;s not an empty land.

<p>Marlon James, a professor of English at Macalester College in Minnesota, is the first Jamaican writer to win for his novel &#8220;A Brief History of Seven Killings.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Jeffrey Brown talked to him at the Miami Book Fair in November.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  This novel is set in a Jamaica you grew up in, right, in the 1970s, &#8217;80s?  A violent time.  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES</strong>, Author, &#8220;A Brief History of Seven Killings&#8221;:  Yes.  </p>
<p>It was a violent time, but it was also a time of a huge explosion in Jamaican culture.  And, funny enough, 1976 is in some ways responsible &#8212; or the 1970s is in some way responsible for my writing career, because the whole idea of writing in the voice of the people, writing in the voice that comes out of my own mouth is a reggae concept.  And it&#8217;s something that also came out of the 70s, which is not to turn a blind eye.  It was a horrible time a lot of the time.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  But pick up on that.  Reggae influenced so many people in terms of music, but it influenced your ear, the voice?  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  Yes, not just &#8212; there&#8217;s quite a few Caribbean writers, the poets first, certainly, but the idea that you &#8212; the voice of &#8212; the voice that was in your mouth, which has always been called broken English, as if it needs to be fixed, could be used to tell very complicated things, stories that have no resolution, characters that you can&#8217;t just dismiss or outright condemn, not falling into this kind of Stepin Fetchit kind of comedy.  </p>
<p>It was something that reggae did.  And that was also something that came out of the &#8217;70s.  It&#8217;s sort of taking cultural ownership of your own voice.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  The plot revolves around an attempted assassination of Bob Marley, but it&#8217;s not a fictional biography of Marley.  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  No.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN: </strong> It&#8217;s just in the background.  </p>
<p>You didn&#8217;t want to do that.  You wanted to set it with him in the center, but then everything else.  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  Him in the center, but spinning &#8212; but the story is really about what&#8217;s going on around him.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  You like that sense of being in history, but not right in the history that we read in the history books?  Yes.  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  Yes, and it&#8217;s been something that has been a concern of mine from my first novel, this sort of interior history of Jamaica, because it starts off being about a bunch of men and women in the whole periphery of Marley, but then it goes on to talk about the Cold War and how the &#8217;70s created the &#8217;80s, and then how we&#8217;re still reeling from that and making sense of that.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  You talked about writing for a sense of sight, for a sense of smell, that kind of sensory perception that comes &#8212; you feel that in your writing?  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  Yes.  </p>
<p>I feel that it&#8217;s something that I teach and something that I have been very sort of deliberate about, because I think we overly on sight, and there&#8217;s more to it than that.  A writer who is really good at invoking all the details is Sebastian Junger.  And he will sometimes nail all five senses in the first 50 words.  I don&#8217;t even know if he is doing it consciously.  So, when&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes.  But you&#8217;re doing it consciously.  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  I do it consciously, because I do &#8212; I am a very &#8212; it&#8217;s funny, because I&#8217;m actually a very &#8212; I&#8217;m not a mechanical writer, but I&#8217;m a mechanical writing teacher.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes?</p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  And you know when people say, I felt like I was there?  </p>
<p>What they are saying is, you unlocked all five senses.  And I think, for example, smell carries memories, smell carries nostalgia.  When was the last time a book made you taste something?  And I think this is really, really important for this sort of immersive feel, especially, in my case, where I am taking them into really negative territory and really dark areas.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  So it&#8217;s not just paint a portrait that I can see.  It&#8217;s put me in there.  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  It&#8217;s putting you in there.  </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to have food, cook it or at least let me &#8212; to smell it.  What does the paint smell like?  I was speaking to the Royal Society for the Blind in England.  And they were giving me a special sort of recognition for the book, because it focuses on all other senses.  </p>
<p>Someone who is visually impaired can still get a full sense of the novel, as opposed to so much of it being locked out from them because we&#8217;re writing so much on sight.  A person who has been blind all his life has no idea what red means.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes.  So how do you write red, right?  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  That&#8217;s a question I ask my class.  Tell somebody who has been blind all their life what red is.  What is &#8212; describe red.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes.  So do you know the impact of winning the Booker?  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  Man, I have no idea.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice seeing it on the bestseller list.  I&#8217;m not complaining.  </p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  I really hope it makes people more curious about Caribbean lit, and beyond Caribbean lit.  </p>
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Which is very rich in a way that we don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  It is very rich.</p>
<p>And even when we talk about rich Caribbean lit, we tend to talk just about English-speaking.  Cuban lit has never needed anybody&#8217;s help.  There&#8217;s great literature coming out of Puerto Rico.  There&#8217;s always been great literature coming out of Haiti, Suriname.  The Dutch Caribbean also writes, and, also, some great new novelists coming out of Barbados and Jamaica.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  All right, &#8220;A Brief History of Seven Killings.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Marlon James, thank you.  And, again, congratulations.  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  Thanks for having me.  </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re going to have food, cook it or at least let me &#8212; to smell it.  What does the paint smell like?  I was speaking to the Royal Society for the Blind in England.  And they were giving me a special sort of recognition for the book, because it focuses on all other senses.  </p>
<p>Someone who is visually impaired can still get a full sense of the novel, as opposed to so much of it being locked out from them because we&#8217;re writing so much on sight.  A person who has been blind all his life has no idea what red means.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes.  So how do you write red, right?  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  That&#8217;s a question I ask my class.  Tell somebody who has been blind all their life what red is.  What is &#8212; describe red.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes.  So do you know the impact of winning the Booker?  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  Man, I have no idea.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice seeing it on the bestseller list.  I&#8217;m not complaining.  </p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  I really hope it makes people more curious about Caribbean lit, and beyond Caribbean lit.  </p>
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Which is very rich in a way that we don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  It is very rich.</p>
<p>And even when we talk about rich Caribbean lit, we tend to talk just about English-speaking.  Cuban lit has never needed anybody&#8217;s help.  There&#8217;s great literature coming out of Puerto Rico.  There&#8217;s always been great literature coming out of Haiti, Suriname.  The Dutch Caribbean also writes, and, also, some great new novelists coming out of Barbados and Jamaica.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  All right, &#8220;A Brief History of Seven Killings.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Marlon James, thank you.  And, again, congratulations.  </p>
<p><strong>MARLON JAMES:</strong>  Thanks for having me.  </p>

<p><strong>ALLEN LEECH, Actor:</strong> Hi. My name is Allen Leech. And I play Tom Branson.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN DOYLE, Actor:</strong> Hello. I&#8217;m Kevin Doyle. I play Joseph Molesley.</p>
<p><strong>PHYLLIS LOGAN:</strong> The single word that describes my character, that&#8217;s a tricky one, actually.</p>
<p><strong>ALLEN LEECH:</strong> Honesty.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN DOYLE:</strong> Fragile.</p>
<p><strong>HUGH BONNEVILLE:</strong> Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>PHYLLIS LOGAN:</strong> I think it would probably have to be sincere.</p>
<p><strong>ALLEN LEECH:</strong> Tom has grown massively as a character. He&#8217;s gone from being a very strong socialist, with very strong and hard views against the aristocracy, to a person who has been able to break down those barriers and see them as people, rather than just a stereotype.</p>
<p><strong>HUGH BONNEVILLE:</strong> The character of Robert Crawley has grown by about three inches around the waste.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN DOYLE:</strong> He&#8217;s developed from being, I would say, comic relief, a figure of fun, to a more rounded, recognizable human being.</p>
<p><strong>PHYLLIS LOGAN:</strong> Well, she has certainly grown, in as much as she seems to have attracted the eye of Mr. Carson, the butler. So, she certainly developed a romantic life throughout the seasons. So, that is nice for her.</p>
<p><strong>HUGH BONNEVILLE:</strong> The character of Robert Crawley has grown incrementally at the pace of a glacier over six seasons to become a more tolerant and more compassionate human being.</p>
<p><strong>PHYLLIS LOGAN:</strong> I think she has &#8212; she&#8217;s a very fair person and has a warm heart and &#8212; but she can &#8212; she is her own woman. Let&#8217;s say that. She definitely doesn&#8217;t take any mmm-mmm from other people. She is her own woman.</p>

<p>Adam Johnson, a professor of creative writing at Stanford and a 2012 Pulitzer winner, won the fiction category for his collection of stories, &#8220;Fortune Smiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeffrey Brown talked with him recently at the Miami Book Fair, starting with a question about the appeal of writing short stories.  </p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON</strong>, Author, &#8220;Fortune Smiles&#8221;:  I love the short story.</p>
<p>Having written two novels in a row, I missed the power of the short story.  To me, a short story is like a battery that can store emotion and just charge you up directly with it, and it can hold emotion for as long as you want and then transmit it.  </p>
<p>I have always loved research.  I have always loved going out into the world and finding a twin for what&#8217;s going on inside me.  Maybe technology&#8217;s part of that.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  So, what starts a story for you?  </p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  I have learned over the years to trust my obsessions.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Obsessions.</p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  When I get obsessed about Nirvana songs, listening to them over and over, or buying Maori jade over the Internet late at night and running up my eBay bill, it usually means it&#8217;s connected to something inside.  And I won&#8217;t know what it is until I put that obsession into a story.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Mm-hmm.  And does it come quickly once you start?  </p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  These stories came very quickly.</p>
<p>You know, when you&#8217;re writing a novel, and it takes years, there are all these beautiful tempting stories that come along and they say, write me.  Oh, no, quit your novel.  That&#8217;s hard work.  It might fail.  Come write me.  I&#8217;m alluring.  And&#8230;</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  But you have got to say no to those.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  You have a personal relationship with these stories, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  That&#8217;s the devil talking, because you must complete your novel and the long journey.  </p>
<p>And when I was done, I couldn&#8217;t wait to go write some stories.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes.  And once you start, is there a lot of chiseling that goes into them?  How crafted are &#8212; no.</p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  I would say, rather than drafting, it&#8217;s more about discovering.  </p>
<p>I write scene by scene, and I think, I want to get my character to this point.  I want to get my characters to the bedroom.  I want to get my characters toward the appearance of the first hologram.  And then I just &#8212; I have to really ponder and think about what is going to happen next.  </p>
<p>I think contemporary fiction is very closely related to improvisational jazz.  The jazz musician has a tradition, has a talent, has some concerns.  It&#8217;s in conversation.  But he or she doesn&#8217;t know what the song is going to be.  It appears before them.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  The first story, called &#8220;Nirvana,&#8221; involves holograms, involves new technology.  There, you had to do a different kind of research, I assume.  </p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  Well, just &#8212; I just had to look around me.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes.  </p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  I live in San Francisco, and I work in Silicon Valley and there are self-driving cars.  And on Stanford campus, there will be flying solar-powered autonomous things zipping around, or things that balance on one wheels that students are making.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  And yet we&#8217;re still human, right, which is part of what comes through in the story.  </p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  That&#8217;s exactly it.  And what is it going to mean to have holograms in our lives?  </p>
<p>You know, Josephine Baker is going on tour next year.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes, you&#8217;re talking &#8212; the great singer ÆMDNMØlong dead, but is going on tour through a hologram.  </p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  Long dead.  That&#8217;s right.  </p>
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  And that triggers something for you.</p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  People are going to fill auditoriums, because the tickets have already sold out for the premiere performances, because they love her.</p>
<p>And it doesn&#8217;t matter.  As long as the human voice is there, I think it doesn&#8217;t matter that it &#8212; she&#8217;s just made of light.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  But that&#8217;s weird, right?  I mean, it&#8217;s strange.  </p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  Well&#8230; </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  She&#8217;s made of light, and people are going to see a dead &#8212; long dead singer perform.  That sounds like an Adam Johnson story, actually.  </p>
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  Do we not look at a television and respond profoundly to cinema and to good TV?  And those people are made of light.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes.  </p>
<p>When you and I talked after you wrote &#8220;The Orphan Master&#8217;s Son&#8221; set in North Korea, you said &#8212; I just went back to look at that interview.  You said to me, when I asked you, why North Korea, &#8220;It seemed, as a writer, that this was perhaps the most difficult place on earth to be fully human.&#8221;</p>
<p>That goes just to what we are talking about, right, this idea of being fully human, even amid technological change, natural disasters, torture.  </p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  That&#8217;s right.  Right.  </p>
<p>Is the state of being human eternal, as we think of it throughout the history of our evolution, or is it mutable?  You know, I&#8217;m not really sure.  As a fiction writer, the thing I&#8217;m scared of the most is phones in stories.  What does it do to tension, inertia, momentum, information management if one character at any moment can share anything at a distance privately with another character?</p>
<p>What does it do to brooding, building, withholding, with human confrontation, conflict, with revelation, if that&#8217;s all subverted through technology?  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  All right, the National Book Award Winner for Fiction, Adam Johnson for his book &#8220;Fortune Smiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congratulations, and thanks.  </p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  Well, thank you.  </p>

<p>When you and I talked after you wrote &#8220;The Orphan Master&#8217;s Son&#8221; set in North Korea, you said &#8212; I just went back to look at that interview.  You said to me, when I asked you, why North Korea, &#8220;It seemed, as a writer, that this was perhaps the most difficult place on earth to be fully human.&#8221;</p>
<p>That goes just to what we are talking about, right, this idea of being fully human, even amid technological change, natural disasters, torture.  </p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  That&#8217;s right.  Right.  </p>
<p>Is the state of being human eternal, as we think of it throughout the history of our evolution, or is it mutable?  You know, I&#8217;m not really sure.  As a fiction writer, the thing I&#8217;m scared of the most is phones in stories.  What does it do to tension, inertia, momentum, information management if one character at any moment can share anything at a distance privately with another character?</p>
<p>What does it do to brooding, building, withholding, with human confrontation, conflict, with revelation, if that&#8217;s all subverted through technology?  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  All right, the National Book Award Winner for Fiction, Adam Johnson for his book &#8220;Fortune Smiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congratulations, and thanks.  </p>
<p><strong>ADAM JOHNSON:</strong>  Well, thank you.  </p>

<p>Jeff is back with their conversation, conducted at the Miami Book Festival.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  There are many personal poems in this.</p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS</strong>, National Book Award for Poetry Winner:  Yes.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  But the long poem that anchors the collection, the &#8220;Voyage of the Sable Venus,&#8221; has a very particular focus, right?</p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  Yes.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  The history of African-American women, their bodies in art.  </p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  Yes.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually the history of black female bodies in art.  So, that&#8217;s part of why I did the project.  It exceeds the national boundaries and even the history of America by several millennia.  It goes back even to 38,000 years, into prehistoric images of black female figures.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  And why?  Why did you want to explore that?  </p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  Well, I didn&#8217;t want it to go back that far.  I didn&#8217;t know that would happen.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes.  </p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: </strong> And then once I started doing research &#8212; and I have a background in ancient languages, and so, of course, I went into the ancient world as well to see what was going on there.</p>
<p>And, of course, I found images of black women in subservient positions, or as the tripod of a lamp, or the handle of a razor blade or handle of a knife.  And I thought, well, how far back does it go?  How long have we been doing this to each other?  That was my primary question.  </p>
<p>And everywhere I looked, regardless of the time period or the continent, it was happening.  And so then I couldn&#8217;t look away.  I had to keep going.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  But why is that poetry?  Why through poetry?  Because that&#8217;s a huge subject.  It&#8217;s a fascinating, important subject.  </p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  Right.  Right.  </p>
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  But why through poetry?</p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  Because poetry is song.  Poetry, first and foremost, is the lyric.  It&#8217;s the music. </p>
<p>And epic is one of the oldest forms we have as human beings.  And I thought that it would be really helpful and also mirror the history itself if I showed &#8212; if I tried to capture this history of how we have looked at black women visually in epic form.  </p>
<p>It made sense to me, as opposed to writing, say, an essay.  I mean, essays are fine.  I love them.  And I write them as well.  But to do it with poem, it&#8217;s like poetry is almost primordial for us, like breathing.  Everybody &#8212; lullabies.  You know, we all know what it means to be sung to.</p>
<p>And poetry is very close to that.  So, I wanted do it that way, so I could keep my reader close.  I didn&#8217;t want to put distance between me and my reader.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Voyage of the Sable Venus is an actual &#8212; is a painting, right?  </p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  It&#8217;s an etching, yes, from the 18th century, 1787, I think.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN: </strong> An etching, yes.</p>
<p>A kind of allegory of a black woman on the passage, right, from Africa to the Caribbean? </p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  Right.  Right.  </p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s a redux of Botticelli&#8217;s Venus on the Half Shell, but, in this case, it&#8217;s a black woman on the clam shell.  And she&#8217;s being drawn through the water by Cupid and Triton or Neptune.  I&#8217;m not sure.  But instead of Neptune having a trident, right, he has a flag of the Union Jack, so it turns out to be a pro-slavery image.</p>
<p>And it is based on a poem, also &#8220;Voyage of the Sable Venus,&#8221; titled &#8220;Voyage of the Sable Venus,&#8221; that speaks about how &#8212; it&#8217;s a pro-rape poem.  It&#8217;s disgusting, how to rape a white woman or a black woman slave at night is the same, because you can&#8217;t see their bodies, 1782.</p>
<p>So, when I heard the title, &#8220;Voyage of the Sable Venus,&#8221; this is the whole experience of looking at that image, where you&#8217;re both completely compelled &#8212; it&#8217;s a gorgeous image &#8212; until you realize that it&#8217;s pro-slavery.</p>
<p>And then the title itself was so gorgeous to me, &#8220;Voyage of the Sable Venus.&#8221;  Right?  So, the complete contradiction of what the image performed and what the title said seemed to me to be a cue to look further.  And so the more I looked and the more titles I found, the weirder it got and the more interesting it got.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Do you &#8212; is it important for you, at least for you work, that poetry connect with things, with history, with&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  Yes, it is.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes?  </p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: </strong> Yes, because, I mean, this is just me, right?  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that all poets should do this, but I feel like I&#8217;m here in the body at a particular time, right?</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Right.  </p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  And that time is completely impacted by very large and very small movements by human beings, whether it&#8217;s on grand historical scale like wars, or small historical scales like, I had a baby.  </p>
<p>All those things are about our time.  They&#8217;re all impacted by how we treat each other, how we live in the world.  So it&#8217;s important to me that that be reflected in my work, for sure.  Otherwise, I feel like I&#8217;m wasting the reader&#8217;s time.  I don&#8217;t want to waste my readers&#8217; time ever.  My readers are very important to me.  </p>
<p>So, if I&#8217;m going to &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to pretend that they&#8217;re not there.  I don&#8217;t want my work to pretend that they&#8217;re not there.  I want them to know at, every moment, I&#8217;m thinking of them.  I don&#8217;t necessarily need to please them.  I don&#8217;t necessarily need to entertain them, but I take very seriously, with great respect.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Engage them.</p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  With great respect.</p>
<p>And I also assume that my readers have great intelligence, so I also don&#8217;t want to talk down to them.  And so all those things go into how I present the work on the page.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  And who do you look to for influences?  </p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  Oh, that&#8217;s such a hard question.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  Yes.  </p>
<p>I mean, who don&#8217;t I look to for influences.  On the one hand I look to, you know, visual artists.  And there is a long list of those people.  And then there&#8217;s musicians, with whom I can&#8217;t live out, Shirley Horn, Charlie Parker.  I don&#8217;t know.  You name it.  Astor Piazzolla, someone was talking about his work today.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Yes.  </p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  And I look to poets, sure, but it&#8217;s just a large, lush, saturated field that I go to.  </p>
<p>Toni Morrison was a big influence on my work since I was a teenager, what she did with English.  I joke that I think she speaks 20 Englishes simultaneously, that she knows how to do that.  It&#8217;s just huge.  It&#8217;s a long list, yes.</p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  All right, Robin Coste Lewis, her book, the &#8220;Voyage of the Sable Venus,&#8221; winner of the National Book Award for Poetry.</p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS:</strong>  Thank you.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: </strong> Thank you so much.  </p>
<p><strong>JEFFREY BROWN:</strong>  Thanks a lot.  </p>
