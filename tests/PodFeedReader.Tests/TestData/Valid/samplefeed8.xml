				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>With the ‘youth movement’ in full swing here for the Vancouver Canucks, there aren’t any players more excited than the guys who are benefiting from it. Guys like Sven Baertschi, Bo Horvat, Jake Virtanen and Jared McCann. Throw Ben Hutton, Jacob Markstrom and Emerson Etem in there, and the Canucks are not even recognizable from the teams that was last coached by John Tortorella and even prior to him, Alain Vigneault. Canucks kids are looking to make their marks with their veteran teammates and with their coaches and fans. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>When Trevor Linden and Jim Benning took over after the firing of Mike Gillis, they said there would be change. However, contracts given out by the previous regime, loss of draft picks in trades, and fan loyalty were some impediments to have to deal with in moving forward as a team and an organization. Despite some questionable moves Benning and Linden have made along the way, they are sticking to their plan and building up the empty cupboards by giving opportunities to young players of the organization. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let’s have a look at the young men of this organization. See what they offer currently, what they can improve in their game and what we can expect from them in the future. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sven-baertschi.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4669" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sven-baertschi-300x169.jpg" alt="sven-baertschi" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sven-baertschi-300x169.jpg 300w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sven-baertschi.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></div>
<div><strong>Sven Baertschi</strong></div>
<div><strong>Stats: 5’11, 190 lbs </strong></div>
<div><strong>Age: 23</strong></div>
<div><strong>Birthplace: Bern, Switzerand</strong></div>
<div><strong>Position: Left Wing</strong></div>
<div>Baertschi was traded from Calgary last season for a 2nd round pick. At the beginning of the season, Sven still had to be stronger on the puck, work harder along the boards, but since that seven game road trip, Baertschi started to show us, just what he can do. What he can do is finish. Baertschi has the natural talent of a goal scorer and ability to find the play. With not impressing Calgary, they were ready to part ways with him and has been given a second chance here in Vancouver. When he first was acquired by the Canucks organization, he was sent to Utica to work with Travis Green. He’s found himself a roster spot on the big team and playing along side Bo Horvat and Radim Vrbata. Sven has found chemistry with Horvat. If this continues in the near future we could be seeing parts of a line that will eventually replace the Sedin’s production. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EEtem.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4670" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EEtem-300x210.jpg" alt="EEtem" width="300" height="210" srcset="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EEtem-300x210.jpg 300w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/EEtem.jpg 619w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Emerson Etem</strong></div>
<div><strong>Stats: 6’1”, 212 lbs</strong></div>
<div><strong>Age: 23</strong></div>
<div><strong>Birthplace: Long Beach, CA, USA</strong></div>
<div><strong>Position: Right Wing</strong></div>
<div>Emerson Etem came to us via trade with the New York Rangers. A young, fast winger with the potential to crash and bang with the best of them. He brings, speed, size, youth and some grit with him. Alain Vigneault doesn’t see him in his coaching plans, but the Canucks can see what he could offer here. Although we’ve only seen one game from Etem, I liked what I saw. He drew three of the four penalties against Florida, including the OT on Jagr, which lead to the Daniel Sedin powerplay goal. I’m looking forward to seeing more for Etem on this road trip. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/HorvatKick.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4671" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/HorvatKick-300x292.jpg" alt="Canucks" width="300" height="292" srcset="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/HorvatKick-300x292.jpg 300w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/HorvatKick.jpg 411w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></div>
</div>
<div><strong>Bo Horvat</strong></div>
<div><strong>Stats: 6’0”, 202 lbs</strong></div>
<div><strong>Age: 20</strong></div>
<div><strong>Birthplace: London, ON, Canada</strong></div>
<div><strong>Position: Centre</strong></div>
<div>With a very good rookie season behind him, Bo Horvat hit what some called a sophomore slump. He went 27 games between goals. A very long drought in the eyes of the public, media, and even Bo Horvat. Through his point production slump, Horvat has had to take on more responsibility when Brandon Sutter went down with injury.  He’s had to take on the No.2 centre position and increased his minutes tremendously. He was still playing a good defensive game and did many of the little things right. Eventually, although he was in a big goal drought, with taking care of all the little things, Bo has been rewarded with some goals as of late. He’s also developed some good chemistry with Sven Baertschi. I’d like to have that play out for as long as we can have it in Vancouver. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/JMccann.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4672" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/JMccann.jpg" alt="JMccann" width="280" height="180" /></a></div>
</div>
<div><strong>Jared McCann</strong></div>
<div><strong>Stats: 6’0”, 179 lbs</strong></div>
<div><strong>Age: 19</strong></div>
<div><strong>Birthplace: Stratford, ON, Canada</strong></div>
<div><strong>Position: Centre</strong></div>
<div>McCann came in to the season guns blazing. Some quick goals and some great moves. He’s fast, he’s got the instinct to go to the net. He has some scoring prowess. As a centre, you can see his game in how he sees the ice. However, as a centre, he also needs to learn how to win face-offs. He’s got all the tools to be a very good 2nd line centre. Although in terms of points, McCann has slowed down, if he keeps doing the right things, you can see McCann really blossom in the next couple of years. Horvat and McCann as 1 and 2 after the Sedins retire looks more promising than not.</div>
<p><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jake-virtanen-lars-eller.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4673" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jake-virtanen-lars-eller-300x225.jpeg" alt="jake-virtanen-lars-eller" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jake-virtanen-lars-eller-300x225.jpeg 300w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jake-virtanen-lars-eller.jpeg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Jake Virtanen</strong></div>
<div><strong>Stats: 6’1”, 208 lbs</strong></div>
<div><strong>Age: 19</strong></div>
<div><strong>Birthplace: New Westminster, BC, Canada</strong></div>
<div><strong>Position: Right Wing</strong></div>
<div>Jake Virtanen didn’t quite figure out the NHL as quickly as his draft mate, McCann did . However, what you get from Jake is a hard hitting player with some scoring ability. Virtanen doesn’t quite have the size of a typical power forward, but he has the skill set to play that game if he wants. What we saw in the World Junior tournament was a Virtanen that was already  used to playing with the level of intensity it takes to play the NHL game. I can see Jake being an impact player for this team. People are joking around calling him the next “Jannik Hansen” and I like it, but I think he’s more a Martin Gelinas type of player. That’s just the vibe I get from Virtanen when he plays.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div><strong><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BHutton.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4674" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BHutton-288x300.jpg" alt="BHutton" width="288" height="300" srcset="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BHutton-288x300.jpg 288w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BHutton.jpg 570w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" /></a></strong></div>
</div>
<div><strong>Ben Hutton</strong></div>
<div><strong>Stats: 6’2”, 183 lbs</strong></div>
<div>
<div><strong>Age: 22</strong></div>
<div><strong>Birthplace: Brockville, ON, Canada </strong></div>
</div>
<div><strong>Position: Defense </strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hutton came out of camp with no expectations, but clearly was the stand out defenceman out of the class who had little to no NHL experience. He played so well, he ended up taking the spot of one Frank Corrado, who was subsequently waived (although I thought I was a bad move) to make room for Hutton on the blue-line. What Hutton brings is the smooth skating ability much like Mattias Ohlund, with some offensive creativity of Jyrki Lumme. He looks calm and relaxed out there and with him back, he’s made Weber play a little better recently. Hutton, along with Tanev and Sbisa will be part of the blue line for a while to come. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>With such drastic moves towards getting the team younger, we as fans, have to know it’s going to be a process. Growing pains are expected and we, as a fanbase, should be more patient with the changes. </div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The Vancouver Canucks end the Florida Panthers 12 game winning streak, like they ended the Montreal Canadiens nine game winning streak earlier in the season. I had a feeling the streak would end here, and it did. Here are some thoughts about the game last night and brouhaha that ensued after the OT winner by Daniel Sedin. </div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong>Game Notes</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Roberto Luongo showed why he was given a 12 year contract by former Vancouver GM Mike Gillis. That glove-save on Bo Horvat reminded us why he was once our No.1 and why he is going to the All-Star Game this season. </div>
<div>
<div style="width: 500px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-4655-1" width="500" height="280" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CYgQ7-oUoAA_H5Z.mp4?_=1" /><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CYgQ7-oUoAA_H5Z.mp4">http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CYgQ7-oUoAA_H5Z.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>Video credit: <a href="https://twitter.com/gregballoch" target="_blank">@GregBalloch</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Emerson Etem has some wheels. With his speed, Etem drew two penalties last night. The OT penalty on Jagr proved to be the key on beating the Panthers. I’m going to like this kid. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jaromir Jagr can still play hockey. The oldest player in the NHL at 43 years of age, can still be a scoring threat. If not for some good goaltending from Jacob Markstrom, Jagr would have added another goal to his HOF tally. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jacob Markstrom shut it down after the 1st period. Not disregarding his passing mistake and lack of defensive presence in front of him on the Jokinen goal, Markstrom gave his team a chance to get back into the game and eventually win it. His excellent play has helped the Canucks have this seven game home-stand 4-2-1. With the return of Miller, Willie can breathe easy and give Miller more rest now that Markstrom has shown him the goods.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jake Virtanen scored his second goal of the year on Roberto Luongo to tie up the game. When that happened, I couldn’t help it…  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot_2016-01-12-14-07-572.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4658" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot_2016-01-12-14-07-572.jpg" alt="Screenshot_2016-01-12-14-07-57~2" width="550" height="615" srcset="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot_2016-01-12-14-07-572-268x300.jpg 268w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot_2016-01-12-14-07-572-916x1024.jpg 916w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot_2016-01-12-14-07-572-900x1006.jpg 900w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot_2016-01-12-14-07-572.jpg 1437w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a>Here&#8217;s Jake&#8217;s goal on Luongo</div>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Daniel Sedin scores twice, including the OT winner, to tie Markus Naslund as the Canucks franchise leader in goals. A story that should have eclipsed everything but was overshadowed by a brouhaha that ensued after the winning goal. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Brouhaha</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Canucks win the game 3-2 in overtime, snapping the 12 game win streak of the Florida Panthers. Shortly after the winning goal,  Henrik Sedin did a fly-by toward the Florida bench due to something that was said to them by a member of the Panthers prior to OT starting. The comment was disparaging enough for both Sedins to be angry about it. These guys usually good about shrugging things said on the ice off, but not last night. In their post-game interviews, you could see they were angry about the comment. Here is what I saw during the melee that ensued after the win. <div id="attachment_4660" style="width: 555px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/canucks-panthers.jpg.size_.xxlarge.promo_.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4660" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/canucks-panthers.jpg.size_.xxlarge.promo_.jpg" alt="Bench brawl ensues after Canucks win.

<ul>
<li>Twins do fly-bys past the Panthers bench. Singling out the unnamed player (assuming it was Thornton)</li>
<li>Daniel gets squirted with a water bottle and Dorsett take exception and chirps the bench</li>
<li>Montoya takes a swing at Dorsett and then Dorsett retaliates </li>
<li>Canucks come in from centre ice to intervene</li>
<li>Luongo still in full gear shoved his stick in Dorsett’s face and then later leaves the bench to stand next to Markstrom</li>
<li>Prust caught at the Panther bench with no backup, until Hockey Wives co-star, Ryan Miller separates some Panthers away from Prust </li>
<li>This went on for a good few minutes after the game ended </li>
<li>Commentary from both broadcast crews had something to say, especially Florida’s Denis Potvin about the twins and mainly Daniel Sedin ( I will address this later on) </li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<div>It was an entertaining game and today in the mid-afternoon the day after, I am still engaged enough to write about it and some messages I received over the morning and late last night. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It brings me to the a couple of things that have been bothering me about ’things said’ and ’things supposedly said’. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>The On-Ice Comment Angered the Sedins</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>For as long as I can remember, the Sedins have been taking a lot of crap from players, media and fans from all over the league, including right here in Vancouver. In fact, admittedly, I wasn’t very fond of them when they were drafted. I later changed my tune, once I saw these guys play. Even with their struggles, I saw their brilliance. I soon became a fan.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The ’sisters’ remarks and taunts are old. The weird sexual and incestual innuendos that many have spewed over the year and even as recently from guys like Jamie Benn and Tyler Seguin of the Dallas Stars. NBC national broadcaster, Mike Milbury, calling them ‘girls’ “sisters’ on national TV as well as many fans and media members across the league questioning their “toughness”. The list goes on and on and on. I am amazed the Sedins haven’t cracked sooner. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Whatever was said to Daniel and Henrik before overtime, was enough to get them to shove it in that guy’s face after the win. I liked what I saw from Hank and Danny, it shows that they are not to be messed with. Perhaps, the league, fans and media will start showing them the respect they both deserve. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Denis Potvin called Daniel Sedin a “low life” </strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don’t care about his ‘peanut butter comment’. No one knows what it even means. I don’t think Denis himself knows what it meant. The comment he made about calling Daniel a “low life” made me laugh and angry at the same time.  It also did no favours for Denis Potvin’s credibility as a person and a broadcaster. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>First off, it was unprofessional. As much as people gripe that Cheech can be a bit of a homer (and I am not arguing), Potvin just made himself look like a fool to anyone that has any brains and even knows the Sedins a little, that he’s so wrong. He just made himself look like he will say just about anything to keep his Florida Panthers in the good light. That’s fine, but not to the point you’re making defamatory comments about a guy who has a reputation of being a class act and *is* one. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Second, when I hear Denis Potvin call anyone a “low life”, I can’t help but shake my head and remember what was said about him in the past.  For those that do not know. During his time as a player for the NY Islanders, Denis <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/14/sports/the-changing-lives-of-denis-potvin.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">Potvin’s wife has claimed in a court of law that Potvin has beaten her repeatedly</a>. She also claimed that Potvin was under the influence of drugs and alcohol often when she received these beatings. So when Denis goes off talking about who is a “low life”, he should, perhaps, take a step back, and look in the mirror. </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was a game full of everything. It had great goals, great saves and big drama. Not bad for a Monday night game on the NHL schedule. I was thoroughly entertained and rode an emotional roller coaster.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s the return of the Lack! Eddie&#8217;s back in town for the first time after his trade to Carolina back in August. Eddie Lack will be between the pipes for the Hurricanes tonight at Rogers Arena. Facing his old team for the first time this season, Lack is looking forward to the game and opportunity to play in familiar settings.</p>
<p>As Vancouver&#8217;s backup goaltender, Lack became some sort of an icon in these parts. His twitter posts, his great smile and his love for tacos have made Eddie Vancouver&#8217;s favourite goalie backup of all time and social media rock star. </p>

<p>Eddie Lack is a fantastic person. You see it with the way he interacts with everyone he comes into contact with, but the whole media/social media love affair with Eddie Lack didn&#8217;t get me enough to think he was good enough to steal the starting job from a proven NHL veteran goaltender in Ryan Miller last season, and from future HOF&#8217;er Roberto Luongo the season previous. Sorry, I don&#8217;t believe the hype.</p>
<p>Eddie had a good run, he is a fine tender, and one Melanson loved to have play the type game typical of a Rolly goalie, but I will take Jacob Markstrom and Ryan Miller over Eddie Lack any day. It&#8217;s not just because I am a Canucks fan first, but in my opinion, Markstrom has more potential to be a starter in the NHL eventually,and Miller has played better than his record indicates (defensive play is another story and another blog).</p>
<p>I like Eddlie Lack, he played well enough here that I didn&#8217;t want him out of here like I wanted other players in the past gone. I wish him a good career in the NHL, but now that he is no longer a Canuck, I won&#8217;t be going out and buying an Eddie Lack Hurricanes jersey any time soon. Tonight, I for one, hope the Vancouver Canucks pepper him with shots and pot a few pucks past Lack for a victory.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The evolution of Jannik Hansen has been a wonderful and steady progression. Picked in the <a href="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=78706">9th round of the 2004 NHL entry draft</a>, many did not see a real future for Vancouver Canucks right winger. Early in his career, Hansen spent much time going back and forth between the Canucks then farm team, The Manitoba Moose. It wasn&#8217;t until the Canucks&#8217; Stanley Cup run back in 2010/2011 did Hansen become a regular for the team, playing a 3rd or 4th line role with limited minutes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4637" style="width: 461px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HansenBleedsCanucksBlue.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4637" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HansenBleedsCanucksBlue.jpg" alt="A shot of bloody Hansen shows just how tenacious he plays. " width="451" height="290" srcset="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HansenBleedsCanucksBlue-300x193.jpg 300w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HansenBleedsCanucksBlue.jpg 451w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A shot of bloody Hansen shows just how tenacious he plays.</p></div>
<p>Since then, Hansen has become the best utility guy for the Canucks playing anywhere he could contribute. He is on the penalty kill, he is sometimes on the power-play and he can float between a scoring line role to a shutdown line when needed. These days, that&#8217;s on the first line with Henrik and Daniel Sedin. This move has regulated Alex Burrows to the 3rd line, where Hansen used to be. Hansen been a great shot of Adrenalin for the twins who seem to having a renaissance year at 35 years of age. Hansen&#8217;s speed and crash and bang style of play has opened up the Sedins game and has his linemates in the top 15 in scoring in the NHL. Here is exactly what Hansen has been so good at this season&#8230;</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/D9fogsP6uac?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>How high is Jannik Hansen&#8217;s ceiling? Who knows, but it&#8217;s been great to see it unfold this season.  I&#8217;m sure Hansen is feeling pretty good about his game as well. Hansen is a hard worker and has proved he belongs on the line with the Sedins.  He&#8217;s won that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_J._Hume_Award">Fred J. Hume Award</a> twice as the Vancouver Canucks &#8220;Unsung Hero&#8221;  in 2011 and 2013. But it&#8217;s getting more and more obvious as this season progresses, you can drop the &#8220;unsung&#8221; part. Hansen has stepped up as one of the leaders on this team but scoring goals and helping the Sedins score them too. </p>
<p>It sure beats Torts chastising him on the bench like this&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hansentorts.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4638" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hansentorts.gif" alt="hansentorts" width="320" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Or former teammate, Cory Schneider doing impersonations of his voice&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/LFdBvWSQBvQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Hansen has embraced his new role this season as a 1st line RW. He&#8217;s learned to just play his game with the Sedins. In the past, Hansen would try to play too much of a finesse game when he was put on the 1st line and looked out of place doing so. These days, Hansen keeps his game simple and it has worked. Hansen has hit a career high of 16 goals twice in his NHL career. This year at the 37 game mark, the feisty right-winger has recorded 12 tallies. Barring injury and his trigger stick going cold for extended periods of time, Hansen is on pace for a career year. From the 9th round to the top line, it&#8217;s been quite the evolution of Jannik Hansen. I don&#8217;t know anyone, with the exception of  my friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/richardloat">@RichardLoat</a>, who thought Hansen was going to stay in the NHL years after his Canucks debut.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>We haven&#8217;t written one of these in a few years, so I thought I&#8217;d give it a revisit this season. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Twas the Nucks before Christmas: 2015</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the Rog<br />Not a feature was playing, no video montage.</div>
<div>The stands were all empty and the ice rink was bare,</div>
<div>In hopes that St. Nicholas will soon would be there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The players were nestled, all snug in their beds</div>
<div>While visions of game wins danced in their heads.</div>
<div>Willie D smiling, behind the bench where he stood</div>
<div>A few days off for all, “Ah, real good, real good.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>No team out there losing to a chorus of boos</div>
<div>In hopes for a pick with the surname, Matthews</div>
<div>No bitching from GMan, No Provies from Botch</div>
<div>No broadcasters sipping big glasses of Scotch</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Production crew off-set, no one manning the show</div>
<div>No fans up high in the stands, no fans down below.</div>
<div>No Jared McCann around, for us fans to cheer</div>
<div>No Brandon Prust with his cold glare and mean sneer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>No sight of Bartkowski, so fast, so damn quick</div>
<div>No Yannick Weber, no shots from his stick.</div>
<div>So youthful and so fresh is this one&#8217;s hockey game</div>
<div>He checked and he banged, Jake Virtanen by name!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Now Daniel! Now Henrik and a badger named Jannik!</div>
<div>Go Burrowsl! Go Edler! Opposition in panic!</div>
<div>To the top of the crease, all balls to the wall!<br />Now hit away! Shoot away! Score away all!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Game evolution for our young Bo Horvat</div>
<div>My husband still wishing for displayed in-house stats</div>
<div>Miller and Markstrom are spared from puck shots</div>
<div>No Cracknell, no Vey  to stand on face-off dots</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now 12, and 16,and 19  raised to the roof</div>
<div>‘Oh Captain, my captain’, your greatness with proof</div>
<div>Now there’s No.10 who elevated the game</div>
<div>Pavel Bure was honoured and in the Hall of Fame</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Henrik to Daniel, their passes so merry!</div>
<div>Lighting up the goal lamp, bright red as a cherry!</div>
<div>Alex Edler is scoring like crazy from the blue line</div>
<div>Chris Tanev’s playing so cool and  sublime</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Dorsett was dressed all in gear, from his head to his foot,</div>
<div>Fighting in the corners, his jersey all dirty with soot.</div>
<div>Sbisa hitting hard, Alex Biega blocking shots,</div>
<div>Hutton owning the zone, like it was Fort Knox.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Dan Hamhuis at home, resting and rehabbing his jaw</div>
<div>Some fans wishing for Crawford, ‘caw caw, caw caw’</div>
<div>In a blink of an eye, and a strange twist of fate</div>
<div>I was at the Garage, at my regular gate</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The stands were all full, many months passed us by,</div>
<div>And all of a sudden it appeared it was hockey in July!</div>
<div>Visions of battered faces and a bloody red nose,</div>
<div>Ryan Miller our tender, to the occasion he rose!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With the sound of the horn and the blow of the whistle,<br />Bone crunching sounds along with the stretch of the gristle.<br />I’ll see you on Robson with foamy-head pucks!</div>
<div>“Maybe Lord Stanley will be there with the Vancouver Canucks!”</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Vancouver Canucks have lost Henrik Sedin to injury, leaving them thin in the middle. Linden Vey has been called up from Utica to join the Canucks in Detroit tonight. Last night in Philadelphia, Henrik was hurt in the first period of the game and did not return. A lower body injury was the report. I have a suspicion this has been an on-going injury that was propelled to worse after that hit along the boards in the first of yesterday&#8217;s game.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4611" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/henrik_sedin_van_032612.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4611" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/henrik_sedin_van_032612.jpg" alt="Henrik Sedin is day to day with a lower body injury as they head into Detroit on the second of a back to back.

<p>Brandon Sutter has been out with an abdominal injury and went through a successful sports hernia surgery not long ago and is recovering. Sedin and Sutter the Canucks&#8217; No.1 and No.2 centers. Henrik is top 10 in scoring in the NHL, his production with brother Daniel, has been most of the production for the Canucks overall. While Sutter&#8217;s 200 foot game has been surely missed, especially on the Canucks penalty kill.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4613" style="width: 531px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Brandon-Sutter-770x470-e1450469055566.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4613" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Brandon-Sutter-770x470-e1450469055566.jpg" alt="Sutter is now recovering from a successful sports hernia surgery." width="521" height="318" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sutter is now recovering from a successful sports hernia surgery.</p></div>
<p>Due to these injuries down the middle, Linden Vey has been called up from the Utica Comets to fill a gap. Jared McCann will be staying with the Canucks and not joining Jake Virtanen at the Hockey World Junior Championship. In the middle of a six game road trip, Hank&#8217;s injury couldn&#8217;t come at worse time. The Canucks have struggled on the road, having difficulties scoring. Henrik is listed as day to day and doubtful to play in Detroit.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4615" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/OyVey.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4615" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/OyVey.jpg" alt="Linden Vey has been called up from Utica to fill in the gaps at centre." width="620" height="478" srcset="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/OyVey-300x231.jpg 300w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/OyVey.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Linden Vey has been called up from Utica to fill in the gaps at centre.</p></div>
<p>The Canucks aren&#8217;t the only ones thinning up front, due to all the call-ups, the Comets are dressing 7 defencemen to fill their lineup.</p>
<p>Thin in the middle and flat on the back isn&#8217;t a good sign for the rest of the road trip for the Vancouver Canucks. Now sporting a three game losing skid and getting closer to the basement of the Western Conference, the Canucks are looking closer to high draft pick than lower playoff seed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night in Anaheim, was the worst effort as a team the Canucks have put forth all season. They were pushed around, out-worked and out-classed on all levels. However, some of the shenanigans that went on last night, could have been snuffed out, had certain 4th line players stepped up and took it upon themselves to not allow some events to happen. So here is an open letter to Dorsett and Prust.</p>
<p><em>Dear Brandon and Derek,</em></p>
<p><em>Last night, was the worst collective team effort I have seen in a couple of years. Not since the John Tortorella era have I seen the Canucks play this piss-poorly. So I am not going to put it all on your shoulders&#8230;BUT&#8230;there were certain incidents I felt the two of you could have curbed with your &#8216;talents&#8217; on the ice. Unfortunately, you two didn&#8217;t curb those events and it cost your team more than the game.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ryan Getzlaf crosschecks Jake Virtanen in the ribs</strong>.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/kwFKTjI0jn8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p><em>How can anyone let anyone do this to a rookie without, for lack of a better word, retribution? What one of you should have done is let Getzlaf know, you saw it, don&#8217;t do it again, with some physical play. </em></p>
<p><strong>Corey Perry using Ryan Miller as an Ottoman</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_4599" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/PerryKneeMills.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4599" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/PerryKneeMills.jpg" alt="Anaheim Ducks right wing Corey Perry uses his knee to pin down Vancouver Canucks goalie Ryan Miller as Canucks defenseman Dan Hamhuis covers the puck during the second period of a NHL hockey game Monday, Nov. 30, 2015, in Anaheim, Calif.  (AP Photo/Lenny Ignelzi)" width="620" height="385" srcset="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/PerryKneeMills-300x186.jpg 300w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/PerryKneeMills.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Excuse me Ryan, mind if I sit on you?&#8221; &#8211; Corey Perry knee on Miller&#8217;s arm and weight on his back. Lovely.</p></div>
<p><em>He is our goaltender. He&#8217;s our starting goaltender. Why is this allowed to happen? I understand Hamhuis should have been the guy in the first place to not even allow it to happen, but I would gladly have one of you guys take a goaltender interference penalty, just to get the message across. Ryan Miller has been mowed down like a golf course green and it has to stop. Most fans expect you, Brandon and Derek, to take it upon yourselves to make sure it&#8217;s not OK to run down our goalies.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hit Somebody</strong></p>
<p><em>Henrik Sedin out-hit both of you combined. That&#8217;s right, Henrik Sedin. Let that sink in for a moment. He had three hits. The both two most physical players combined for two. That&#8217;s a telling tale and not a good one.</em></p>

At this point, all the damage has been done. No fight back whatsoever from Prust or Dorsett. Go at it, Ryan!</p></div>
<p><em>Jim Benning wanted a &#8220;safe work environment&#8221; for the young guys and the stars. In this game, Miller; Virtanen; and McCann can tell you differently. That&#8217;s why guys like you, Brandon and Derek, were brought into the fold, and being paid scoring players&#8217; money to do it. That&#8217;s $5million or so dollars the Canucks pay you to make sure this type of game doesn&#8217;t happen. What the heck were you two doing last night?</em></p>
<p><em>Brandon, you have sweet twitter game. But if we wanted twitter game, we would have kept Eddie Lack. This needs to be addressed by the both of you. That means to make sure guys like Getzlaf, Kesler and Perry don&#8217;t ever do that to our boys again. We all have jobs to do, your team and your fans need you blokes to do yours.</em> </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/aviewfromabroad">@Aviewfromabroad </a></p>
<p>On to LA and hopefully a more physical game against a very big and heavy Kings team. We are all now looking to see if Prust and Dorsett will respond on the ice when it is necessary. However, if we see what we saw in Anaheim again, the management might have to rethink their approach in finding guys who will stand up for their teammates.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three Up, Three Down: Shootout in Dallas</p>
<p>The Canucks are in Dallas to face-off with the Stars, but before that, they thought to take in some American Thanksgiving tradition and bought a suite in <em>Jerrywood </em>for the day. Rumour has it, the Sedins were the ones to arrange all this, but you would never hear either of them take credit.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4588" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NucksatCowboys-e1448693740147.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4588" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NucksatCowboys-e1448693740147.jpg" alt="Nice way for the team to bond on American Thanksgiving. " width="600" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Nice way for the team to bond on American Thanksgiving. Too bad the Cowboys lost, well, not really. I&#8217;m a Cam Newton fan. </em></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tonight, we saw the Canucks out-shoot the Stars, but nonetheless, they lose to the best team in the Western Conference in a shootout. This was also the first game the Canucks came back to send into OT after being down after two periods. A few improvements, but still some questions are looming the Canucks, especially in the play of their special teams. However, we have our three standouts in this game. Oddly enough, all three have one thing in common. They are all 35 years old.</p>
<p><strong>THREE UP</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Daniel Sedin:</strong> Daniel was the best skater tonight for the Canucks. A goal to tie it up 1-1 and an incredible assist on the power-play on a goal for Henrik to knot it at 2-2, sending the game to OT and eventually a shootout. That pass to Henrik for the goal ended up using Johnny Oduya like a croquet wicket and shuffling the puck between his legs.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/yMu48oU1UeY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong>2. Ryan Miller: </strong>Ryan Miller was spectacular, but in OT, he was brilliant. That leg stretched out to make that save, unreal. Only Seguin beat Miller in the shootout, but it was enough for the Stars.</p>
<p><strong>3. Henrik Sedin:</strong> Captain Hank and his doppelganger seem to be the main source of offense for the Canucks lately. Twins on the power-play are money, even if they don&#8217;t always score. When you see them on the ice with the man advantage, they are usually possessing the puck and keeping play in the attacking zone. Tonight, it was no different, but that beautiful twin telepathy they possess resulted in the 2-2 tying goal. Watch Daniel&#8217;s pass on Hank&#8217;s goal. </p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/3UVuImDjX3c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong>THREE DOWN</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.Alex Edler:</strong> I&#8217;m not sure where his head has been lately, but the bad passes and turnovers have making him look like Tortorella was still coaching this team. Sometimes I feel he has ear buds on and listening some indie rock and not really paying attention to what is happening around him.</p>
<p><strong>2.Penalty Killing: </strong>The Canucks have allowed 14 goals in 12 games, being a man down. Against Dallas, they allowed two goals on five PKs.  Do I need to go into it more than that? That is dreadful and for this team, unacceptable. </p>
<p><strong>3.Willie Desjardins:</strong> A few things that did not make Willie &#8220;real good&#8221; in this game vs. the Stars. Willie&#8217;s untimely bench minor penalties of &#8216;too many men&#8217; are often happening. Too many men on the ice in OT should never be happening. Never. If it wasn&#8217;t for the stellar play of Miller, the Canucks would have another  3-on-3 OT loss in the books.</p>
<p>Also, Higgins on the shootout? I don&#8217;t mind Higgins, but he hasn&#8217;t had a goal since early in the last road trip and only two for the year. He hit a post in this game, but it wouldn&#8217;t be enough to put him in as the third shooter. However, my biggest gripe with Desjardins is his reluctance to play the young guys more late in the game and especially in OT. My biggest pet peeve in the extra period is Willie&#8217;s insistence of having a double D-man combo to hit the ice. Why? 3on3 OT should be all about offense, so let&#8217;s just keep it to two forwards and one blue-liner.</p>
<p><strong>HONOURABLE MENTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jared McCann:</strong> This kid just &#8216;gets it&#8217;. Each and every game, he is improving and willing to work for it. He had four shots on goal against Dallas, and if he keeps that up, the puck will start going into the net again.</p>
<p><strong>Jannik Hansen:</strong> Whatever Jannik Hansen is doing out there, it&#8217;s creating opportunities for the Sedins that we haven&#8217;t seen in a few years. Hansen is Burrows 2.0. He is doing exactly what Burrows did for the twins back in their Art Ross days with a little more speed. Great for us to see, but even better for Daniel and Henrik.</p>
<p><strong>Yannick Weber:</strong> A  few fans in the twitterverse don&#8217;t want to see Weber on the ice, but in all honesty, he hasn&#8217;t been as glaringly bad as some seem to think. Between him and Sbisa, the blue line whipping boys positions are currently occupied. I know he&#8217;s not the most physical D-man and he is definitely our smallest. He is also a guy who isn&#8217;t afraid to shoot the puck from the back end and get it through some traffic. He had 10 shot attempts and a team high five shots on goal. You can&#8217;t fault him for working his game to stay in the lineup. Were we not complaining about not shooting enough?</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/IXvzxrtVUms?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Another overtime loss, another overtime point. Do you remember when the Oilers went to the Stanley Cup final recently? They had less wins than the Canucks, beat them out for the final playoff spot but the amount of OTL&#8217;s gave them 8th place and a run to the Stanley Cup. I&#8217;m not saying I wouldn&#8217;t like to win one of these 3 on 3 overtimes, but I sure would rather take the point than none at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve done one of these, so here we go! Three Up, Three Down: Sniper Spotted in St. Paul.</p>
<p>Canucks came home from a seven game road trip for only two home games, back to back last weekend. Only to hit the road again for a four game Western Conference trip. First stop, St. Paul, MN to visit the Minnesota Wild. The Wild ] just happen to be the best team at home in the NHL currently. Prior to this Canucks visit, only the Nashville Predators, have won at the Xcel Energy Center so far this season. The Canucks have had much difficulty winning on Wild home ice for as long as I could remember. The Canucks had a hard time winning there even during this famous stare down&#8230;</p>

Keeping one&#8217;s mouth shut might have been a good idea back then.</p></div>
<p>However, the Canucks managed to win 3-2 in St. Paul, MN, with a few veteran players making a big difference.</p>
<p><strong>THREE UP</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Radim Vrbata: </strong>For the Canucks leading goal scorer last season, Vrbata has been battling get to his production going this year. Radim had only four goals prior to this game. A far cry from how they were all going on this time last year. However he scored a couple of beauties, included the first one from a sweet pass by Jared McCann. He then added a PPG from Henrik to give the Canucks the lead. Perhaps we can bring back the famous &#8220;Mean Mug&#8221; picture from an old press conference.<br /><div id="attachment_4580" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Vrbadass-e1448519617468.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4580" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Vrbadass-e1448519617468.jpg" alt="This is quite the stare. As many of the followers on twitter know, @TheStanchion got a lot of mileage from this one picture. #Vrbadass" width="400" height="258" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is quite the stare. As many of the followers on twitter know, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStanchion?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author">@TheStanchion</a> got a lot of mileage from this one picture. <strong>#Vrbadass</strong></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Ryan Miller:</strong> A well rested Ryan Miller looked like All- Star goalie, Ryan Miller. Mid-way through the 1st period, the Canucks&#8217; netminder made six very good saves, until he was beaten by a puck that deflected off Alex Edler&#8217;s leg during a Wild PP. Miller was still right there and squared to the puck. Unfortunately, Edler&#8217;s attempted block inadvertently put the puck into the net. Miller&#8217;s sharp play inspired the team to come back the rest of the game and for the most part, control it. (Minus about a minute and half to go in the 3rd period) .</li>
<li><strong>Daniel Sedin:</strong> Daniel has been a different player, or should I say he is back to being a familiar player this season. This is the first time in a few years, Daniel is once again, Daniel. He&#8217;s shooting 4 or more shots on goal and has scored 10 goals in 22 games. He is also No.4 in the NHL in points. He&#8217;s only behind Seguin, Benn and Patrick Kane but Daniel is doing at 35 years of age. Henrik is 12th in points but only two less tallied behind his brother.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>THREE DOWN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Penalty Kill: </strong>What has usually been a great part of the Canucks&#8217; specials teams in recent years and even the beginning of this season, the PK has looked less than stellar and at times down right ugly. The Canucks penalty killing has allowed 10 goals in 11 games when they are a man down. Its effectiveness has dropped below 70% and needs to vastly improve if they wish to have more success in the near future. </li>
<li><strong>Late 3rd Period Goals Against: </strong>Far too many times this year, we&#8217;ve seen the Canucks allow goals in with the dying minutes of a game, whether  it is tied or the Canucks are up by a goal or two. The Buffalo game, the Canucks fought back to tie the game and lost in regulation with 17 seconds left due a late goal. The Wild came back with one goal and almost scored the tying goal if Miller and his team did not receive a lucky bounce off the crossbar.</li>
<li><strong>200 Foot Game:  </strong>The Canucks have looked like scrambling clowns in their own zone defending. When they are without the puck, their game drops a level. This game wasn&#8217;t a bad example of defensive breakdowns in their own zone with the exception of the first period and the last minute and half of the game. It&#8217;s time to help the goalies and out clear the zone and play smart hockey when defending.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>HONOURABLE MENTIONS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Jannik Hansen</strong>: When Jannik just plays simple hockey, it&#8217;s when his game is most effective. Today he scored a breakaway goal and made it look effortless. As a friend was saying, when Hansen just shoots on a breakaway instead of deke&#8217;ing, it usually goes in. Well, he shot, he scored.</li>
<li><strong>Jared McCann:</strong> McCann  has looked very good this season. He has matured and developed a lot faster than many anticipated. McCann versus the Wild has shown some cohesiveness and  chemistry with Radim Vrbata. McCann helped with this first goal and later in the game almost helped on another, if the puck didn&#8217;t fly past Vrbata.</li>
<li><strong>Bo Horvat:</strong> With all the struggles in his sophomore year so far, Bo Horvat skated hard, played a good 2-way game and tried to create some offense with his linemates. I&#8217;m not going to be too hard on Bo. He has been asked to be a 2nd line centre on this team and taking more minutes as Brandon Sutter is still out with injury.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Goal of the Game:</strong></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/IBfjup7MIMk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/jz7SobKD8PI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>So the Canucks went into Wild Country looking shaky in the 1st period. There was a sniper sighting for the Canucks in the slot and tied the game before going into the 1st intermission. The sniper also showed up on the power play, notching his second. A Honey Badger put the Canucks up by two. Untimely penalties and a barrage of pressure from the Wild got the game to within one. However, the Hockey Gods decided to grace Ryan Miller and the Canucks with a couple of lucky bounces, they knew they owed them some from the last road trip and just like that, road trip starts off with a win.</p>
<p>Nice effort boys, now go enjoy some Thanksgiving football in Dallas!</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving to our American neighbours!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The loss to the Ottawa Senators was a tough one to swallow. Especially since after 17 previous tries, the Vancouver Canucks finally scored on the Power Play. So far the Canucks are 1-2-1 on this road trip with Toronto waiting in the wings on Saturday. However, as a fan base, we are all on the edge of our seats with every stumble on the ice. In Columbus, the Canucks had 15 minutes of power play time, with no goals to show for it. One of them was even for five full minutes! What is happening and what is wrong with the Canucks? I don&#8217;t know for sure, but we can have a look to see what could help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Power Play</strong></p>
<p>Up until Edler&#8217;s very late power play goal versus Ottawa in the 3-2 loss, the Canucks have been 0 for 17 since their last recorded PPG. This was just after going 6 straight games with power play goals making the score sheet. Until the Canucks start punishing teams with their PP, the opposition will continue to take liberties with members of team since they can&#8217;t score on the PP anyway. So what <em>could </em>help?</p>
<ul>
<li>Take Alex Edler off the 1st unit as the guy who can QB the power play. He&#8217;s not. Stop forcing the issue. The signs haven&#8217;t been there, ever. As much as Weber hasn&#8217;t had a great showing in with the extra man (no one else has been great lately either), I&#8217;d much rather have Weber back there throwing his heavy shot towards the net over Edler. Yannick is no Jeff Brown or Jovanovski back there, but there was chemistry that could be rekindled with the Sedins, Vrbata and Burrows. I just don&#8217;t see any of that happening with Edler.</li>
<li>Edler with Hutton on the 2nd unit could work. They are there to support each other on the back-end. With the younger guys up on forward for that unit, it would be good to have a 2-man blue to keep the pucks in the zone.</li>
<li>As simple as winning face-offs in the offensive zone. Win the face-off, control the play. Easy.</li>
<li>Shoot! Great puck movement is wonderful to watch, but putting pucks to the net and using the law of averages will probably create better scoring chances and potential goals. Shooting from the peripheral gives the defending team an easier time to kill their penalty.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Penalty Kill</strong></p>
<p>This aspect of special teams play has usually been a very good part of the Canucks&#8217; game. However on this road trip so far, it&#8217;s been atrocious. Ottawa had two PPGs in the last game.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Physical Play</strong></p>
<p>With two of the more physical players on Injured Reserved, the Canucks cannot expect Jake Virtanen and Brandon Sutter to make all the big hits. The absence of Luca Sbisa has really made the blue line soft. Hamhuis not hip-checking like his used to, Edler having troubles at times just staying on his skates and Tanev not really known as a big hitter but a good positional player, Sbisa&#8217;s &#8216;edge&#8217; is missed.  Weber lacks the size to be physical, I haven&#8217;t seen much from Bartkowski and Hutton is better with the puck than the others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4565" style="width: 530px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Prust.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4565 " src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Prust.jpg" alt="Canucks missing the physicality that Prust and Sbisa bring to the game." width="520" height="502" srcset="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Prust-300x290.jpg 300w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Prust.jpg 619w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Canucks missing the physicality that Prust and Sbisa bring to the game.</p></div>
<p>Prust being out hasn&#8217;t been good for the team either. Sure he&#8217;s a 4th line guy, but his presence and leadership shows. With only Dorsett to defend other teammates, Prust&#8217;s injury has really affected the physical part of the fore-check. There is much lacking. Virtanen has shown he can drill guys with a good hard check, and Hansen has been more effective with the puck than he has without lately, that other guy who can keep the other team in check isn&#8217;t there and isn&#8217;t keeping the dirty stick work at bay.</p>
<p><strong>Goaltending</strong></p>
<p>Ryan Miller has been the Canucks&#8217; best player so far this season. He&#8217;s a big part of the reason why the Canucks have a winning record opposed to one looking more like the Flames. Until recently, he&#8217;s been excellent. However, with only resting for two games, it&#8217;s starting to take its toll on him. The bad defensive play in front of him has not helped out his numbers. With Jakob Markstrom back, Miller will get the much needed rest between starts he will need and gives the Canucks a capable backup who has already shown he&#8217;s ready for the NHL. The least of the concerns for the Canucks is in the blue ice.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4566" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ryan-miller-nhl-vancouver-canucks-edmonton-oilers-850x560.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4566" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ryan-miller-nhl-vancouver-canucks-edmonton-oilers-850x560.jpg" alt="Miller has been good this year, but needs rest to regain his October form.

<p><strong>Bad Luck</strong></p>
<p>We could even bring it down to some bad luck. It was rearing its ugly head in the Ottawa game for sure, but we&#8217;ve seen it earlier in this road trip as well. The bounces aren&#8217;t coming. However, having some lucky bounces on the ice usually coincides with some good play. The Canucks have to play 60 minutes, play a strong 200 foot game and play smart hockey.</p>
<p><strong>Bright Spots</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe they will generally be this bad consistently, but I&#8217;d be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t concerned. It&#8217;s one thing for the Canucks to plod through a tough time, but it&#8217;s another to wallow in it. I do see some good things even though they aren&#8217;t playing their best hockey at the moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sven Baertschi has looked better as of late. Still needs to work along the boards better, he&#8217;s making his way to the net and has been rewarded with two goals.<div id="attachment_4567" style="width: 304px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SvenB.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4567" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SvenB.jpg" alt="Baertschi has improved but still needs to fight for pucks along the boards." width="294" height="347" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Baertschi has improved but still needs to fight for pucks along the boards.</p></div></li>
<li>Jakob Markstrom is back and looked marvelous in his 1st start of the season. This will no doubt be a wonderful relief to everyone, especially Ryan Miller. He doesn&#8217;t have to play so many games now and they can make quite the tandem as the season goes on.</li>
<li>  <a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jacob-markstrom-nhl-vancouver-canucks-dallas-stars-850x560.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4568" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jacob-markstrom-nhl-vancouver-canucks-dallas-stars-850x560.jpg" alt="jacob-markstrom-nhl-vancouver-canucks-dallas-stars-850x560" width="492" height="324" srcset="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jacob-markstrom-nhl-vancouver-canucks-dallas-stars-850x560-300x198.jpg 300w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jacob-markstrom-nhl-vancouver-canucks-dallas-stars-850x560.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /></a></li>
<li>Jake Virtanen has played good physical hockey so far. He&#8217;s also showing he can play a good game if he is given some time.</li>
<li>Ben Hutton has been the nicest surprise of them all. He has the makings of a very good puck moving defenceman one day. His calm demeanor on the blue line has been refreshing to see, and especially from a rookie.<div id="attachment_4569" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/huttondefault.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4569" src="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/huttondefault.jpg" alt="Ben Hutton has shown the poise of a veteran on the blue line so far in his rooke year." width="480" height="360" srcset="http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/huttondefault-300x225.jpg 300w, http://canuckscorner.com/mainblog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/huttondefault.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ben Hutton has shown the poise of a veteran on the blue line so far in his rookie year.</p></div></li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s just about getting the team to click all at once. It can happen at any time. I believe that. It&#8217;s tough to believe it presently  but I can see it happening. There is still a lot of season to play and a few more road trips to win. I&#8217;m concerned, but I&#8217;m not panicked. Patience, my fellow Canucks fans, patience. </p>
